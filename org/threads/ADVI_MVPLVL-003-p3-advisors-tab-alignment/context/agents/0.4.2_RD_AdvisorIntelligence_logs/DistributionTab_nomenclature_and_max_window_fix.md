# DistributionTab Nomenclature + Max Window Fix — 0.4.2_RD_AdvisorIntelligence

**Date:** 2026-03-04
**Portal DEV commit:** `ed832db`

## Objective

Execute task orders `distribution_nomenclature_fix` and `continuous_view_max_window_clients_fix`
on DistributionTab.tsx, plus confirm xtick_spacing_fix (addendum) is already applied.

---

## Work Completed

### 1. Audit of Pre-Applied Changes

Before writing any code, audited DistributionTab.tsx against all three task orders.

**distribution_nomenclature_fix (11 changes):** 10 of 11 already applied in a prior session.
- `SnapshotDistributionChartProps.isNnaMode?: boolean` — present
- `SnapshotDistributionChart` function signature destructures `isNnaMode = false` — present
- Y-axis NNA label: `'Relationships (log)'` instead of `'Number of Relationships'`. Deviation
  is intentional — `(log)` suffix accurately reflects the log scale used in NNA mode. Left as-is.
- X-axis label: `{isNnaMode ? 'Period NNA' : 'Account Size'}` — present
- Tooltip row 1: `{isNnaMode ? 'NNA Range' : 'Account Size'}` — present
- Tooltip row 2: `{isNnaMode ? 'Relationship Count' : 'Account Count'}` — present
- `SnapshotDistributionMetrics` signature has `isNnaMode?: boolean` — present
- Primary tile: `{isNnaMode ? 'Total Relationships' : 'Total Accounts'}` — present
- Both `<SnapshotDistributionChart>` and `<SnapshotDistributionMetrics>` call sites pass `isNnaMode={isNnaMode}` — present
- AUA footnote muted span: `' Distribution reflects funded accounts only, log-spaced bins.'` — present

**xtick_spacing_fix (addendum — 3 changes):** Fully applied.
- Both containers at `h-[450px]` (donut ~line 1271, bell curve ~line 1449) — present
- `AreaChart margin={{ ..., bottom: 50 }}` — present
- `XAxis` uses custom SVG tick renderer with `height={50}`, `dy={12}`, `transform="rotate(-45)"` — present
- Y-axis label div: `justify-center`, `pointer-events-none`, `width: '16px'` — present
- X-axis label div: `bottom: '6px'`, `left: 'calc(50% + 15px)'` — present

### 2. continuous_view_max_window_clients_fix — Implemented (4 changes)

**The issue:** `ContinuousChartView` always shows "New Clients" tile. At Max window,
`data.metadata.new_clients['Max']` is never populated by the backend — always shows '--'.
"New Clients" is also semantically wrong over all time (every client is cumulative total).

**Type investigation:** The task order specified `cohortView?.current?.metrics?.client_count ?? cohortView?.metrics?.client_count`.
This fails tsc: `PartnerAnalyticsView.metrics` is `ViewMetrics` (no `client_count`); only
`PartnerAnalyticsViewWithPeriods.current.metrics` is `PeriodMetrics` (has `client_count`).
Used `hasTimeMachine()` guard (already imported) to satisfy TypeScript.

| Change | Location | What |
|--------|----------|------|
| Interface | `ContinuousChartViewProps` | Added `totalClients?: number` |
| Signature | `ContinuousChartView` | Destructures `totalClients` |
| Call site | `<ContinuousChartView>` in `DistributionTab` | IIFE with `hasTimeMachine` guard derives `view.current.metrics.client_count` |
| Tile | ~line 807 | `window === 'Max'` ternary: label/value switch |

---

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| `hasTimeMachine` guard instead of task order's `??` fallback | `ViewMetrics` has no `client_count` — task order's double-access pattern fails tsc. Guard is correct and already used elsewhere in the file. |
| IIFE at call site | `hasTimeMachine` needs a variable to guard; IIFE keeps it inline without polluting JSX scope above. |
| Leave Y-axis `'Relationships (log)'` as-is | More informative than `'Number of Relationships'`; log scale is factual for NNA mode. |

---

## Files Modified

| File | Change | Committed |
|------|--------|-----------|
| `portal/src/pages/AdvisorIntelligence/tabs/DistributionTab.tsx` | `totalClients` prop wiring + Max window tile fix | Yes — portal DEV `ed832db` |

## Blockers

None.

## Current State

**Status:** COMPLETE
**Active branch:** portal `DEV`

Tasks 1 (nomenclature — pre-applied), 2 (max window — implemented), and 3 (xtick — pre-applied)
are all done. `bunx tsc -b` clean. Portal DEV is now 4 commits ahead of origin: `3dc9dc5`,
`7df26bb`, `5125eb9`, `ed832db`. DE reviews before DT pushes.

---

## Next Steps

1. **[RD 0.4.2] Start H (advi_h_portal_primitives)** — AdvisorsTab panel primitives refactor.
   Must precede I (Top Performers redesign) and 4C (stacked bar).
2. **[RD 0.4.2] Then I (advi_i_top_performers)** — Top Performers visual redesign.
3. **[RD 0.4.2] Then 4C (ADVI-005)** — Stacked bar + rolling 1Y in AdvisorsTab.
4. **[RD 0.4.2] DistributionTab: C3, C1, C2+C4** — in that order.

**Files to touch next:**
- `portal/src/pages/AdvisorIntelligence/tabs/AdvisorsTab.tsx` — H then I then 4C

**Do NOT:**
- Push portal DEV — DT is the push gate after DE reviews
- Start 4C before completing H (structural refactor prevents collision)
