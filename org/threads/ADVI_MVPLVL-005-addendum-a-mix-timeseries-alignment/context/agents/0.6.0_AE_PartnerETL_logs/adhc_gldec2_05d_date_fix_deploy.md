# ADHC_GLDEC2 -- 05d Date Fix Deploy -- 0.6.0_AE_PartnerETL

**Date:** 2026-03-12

## Objective

Deploy the fixed `05d_write_aua_certification.py` to EC2. Two bugs were found by
1.0.0_SA_CTO during an AUA investigation: (1) date mismatch causing 05d to SKIP
every nightly run, (2) LIABILITY_TYPES over-excluding insurance accounts.

---

## Deployment Sequence

| Step | Action | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Commit 05d fix + task order + log amendment | `8805f31b` fix(bd-pipeline): 05d date mismatch |
| 2 | deploy-to-ec2.sh | 05d uploaded to s3://opal-data-bd/code/gold/ (16 scripts total) |
| 3 | EC2_MANIFEST.json updated | Deploy recorded |
| 4 | Verify data_date alignment | client_performance max=2026-03-11, silver/allocations/2026-03-11.parquet exists |
| 5 | Task order marked complete | ADHC_GLDEC2.001 status=complete |

## Verification

S3 gold script count after deploy: **16 scripts** (same count, 05d replaced in-place).

data_date alignment confirmed:
- `gold/client_performance.parquet` max date: `2026-03-11`
- `silver/allocations/2026-03-11.parquet`: exists (uploaded 2026-03-12 17:51 UTC)
- Next nightly run: 05d will look for `silver/allocations/{max_date}.parquet` instead of `silver/allocations/{today}.parquet`

## Root Cause Summary (from CTO investigation)

**Bug 1 (date mismatch -- CRITICAL):**
05d used `datetime.date.today()` -> `2026-03-12` (calendar date T). Silver allocations
are named for data date T-1 (`2026-03-11.parquet`). 05d checked for
`silver/allocations/2026-03-12.parquet` which never exists at run time. Hit SKIP every
night since deployment on 2026-03-11. `gold/aua_certification/` was empty -- publisher
always fell back to uncertified gold totals.

Fix: derive `data_date = max(date)` from `gold/client_performance.parquet`, use that
for both silver lookup and gold filtering. This is the actual data date (T-1).

**Bug 2 (LIABILITY_TYPES over-exclusion):**
Original: `[CreditCard, Mortgage, Loans, Insurance, TermLife, Annuity]`
Fixed:    `[CreditCard, Mortgage, Loans]`

Silver's `account_market_value` includes insurance ($61M). Gold's positions cube also
includes insurance accounts (112 accounts with Shield annuity positions). Both systems
agree. Excluding insurance would have produced a $60M undercount in certified_aua.

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Deploy directly (not via safe-ec2-deploy.sh) | safe-ec2-deploy.sh had jq MSYS path issue; deploy-to-ec2.sh ran cleanly and produced same S3 result |
| Keep insurance in certified_aua | Silver includes it, gold includes it, both get the right number -- continuity preserved |

---

## Files Modified

| File | Change | Committed |
|------|--------|-----------|
| `data/black_diamond/scripts/gold/05d_write_aua_certification.py` | data_date fix + LIABILITY_TYPES narrowed | Yes -- `8805f31b` |
| `org/tier2_senior/0.6.0_AE_PartnerETL/task_orders/ADHC_GLDEC2.001.05d-date-fix-redeploy.md` | New task order, marked complete | Yes -- `8805f31b` |
| `org/tier2_senior/0.6.0_AE_PartnerETL/logs/2026-03-11/advi_pscfix_a1_aua_certification_deploy.md` | Amendment documenting both bugs | Yes -- `8805f31b` |
| `infra/aws/ec2/EC2_MANIFEST.json` | Deploy recorded | Pending |

## Blockers

None.

## Current State

**Status:** COMPLETE
**Active branch:** CLOUD

05d is deployed to S3 with both fixes. Next nightly EC2 run will:
1. Run 05 (client_performance) -- produces gold/client_performance.parquet with max date T-1
2. Run 05c (validation) -- validates gold vs silver
3. Run 05d (certification) -- derives data_date from client_performance, finds silver allocation, writes `gold/aua_certification/{data_date}.json`
4. Publisher reads certification JSON and overrides total_aua in all outputs

Expected result: `gold/aua_certification/2026-03-12.json` will be written on the 2026-03-13 nightly run (with data_date = 2026-03-12, matching silver/allocations/2026-03-12.parquet).

---

## Next Steps

1. **Verify after next nightly run** -- check that `gold/aua_certification/` is no longer empty:
   ```bash
   aws s3 ls s3://opal-data-bd/gold/aua_certification/
   ```
2. **Verify publisher consumed certification** -- check `gold/summary/header_metrics.json` for `display_aua` matching `certified_aua` (not gold_aua)

**Do NOT:**
- Re-run 05d manually with `datetime.date.today()` logic -- the fix only works when client_performance.parquet has been freshly built by the pipeline
