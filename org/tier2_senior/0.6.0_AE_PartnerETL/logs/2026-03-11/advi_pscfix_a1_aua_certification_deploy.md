# ADVI_PSCFIX A1 — AUA Certification Script Deploy — 0.6.0_AE_PartnerETL

**Date:** 2026-03-11
**Start Time:** 22:45
**End Time:** 22:58

## Objective

Write and deploy `05d_write_aua_certification.py` into the BD EC2 gold runner per
task order ADVI_PSCFIX.A1. Script runs daily after 05c_validate_aua_vs_silver.py,
reads silver/allocations/{date}.parquet, excludes liability account types, and
writes `gold/aua_certification/{today}.json` — the certified_aua figure the
bd-portal-publisher Lambda uses to override total_aua fields.

## Deployment Sequence

| Step | Action | Result |
|------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Read task order, PRD, EC2 runner structure | Context established |
| 2 | Write 05d_write_aua_certification.py | `data/black_diamond/scripts/gold/05d_write_aua_certification.py` created |
| 3 | Wire 05d into run_gold_layer.sh (both modes) | `data/black_diamond/scripts/gold/run_gold_layer.sh` modified |
| 4 | Commit source | `6223d2d9` feat(bd-pipeline): add 05d + wire into run_gold_layer.sh |
| 5 | safe-ec2-deploy.sh bd-gold-layer-runner | 15 gold scripts in s3://opal-data-bd/code/gold/ |
| 6 | EC2_MANIFEST.json updated | Manifest commit `9bce21bd` |
| 7 | Mark task order complete | ADVI_PSCFIX.A1.aua-certification-script.md status=complete |

## Verification

S3 gold script count after deploy: **15 scripts** (was 14 before 05d).

05d confirmed uploaded:
```
s3://opal-data-bd/code/gold/05d_write_aua_certification.py
```

run_gold_layer.sh confirmed uploaded:
```
s3://opal-data-bd/code/gold/run_gold_layer.sh
```

## Decisions Made

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| Script exits 0 on all error paths (try/except in `__main__`) | Non-blocking requirement — pipeline must continue regardless |
| 05c called via `if [ -f ... ]` guard in runner | 05c does not exist yet (ADVI_49FNV3.008 still pending). Guard lets 05d deploy cleanly now; 05c will be wired unconditionally when it's written |
| 05d called with `|| true` (not via `run_script()`) | `run_script()` passes `--upload` flag which 05d doesn't need; also avoids set -e failure on non-zero exit edge cases |
| Script placed in `data/black_diamond/scripts/gold/` (not `infra/aws/ec2/bd_pipeline/scripts/`) | Task order path doesn't exist; gold scripts canonical location is gold/ dir per deploy-to-ec2.sh sync paths |

## Files Modified

| File | Change | Committed |
|------|--------|-----------|
| `data/black_diamond/scripts/gold/05d_write_aua_certification.py` | New script | Yes — `6223d2d9` |
| `data/black_diamond/scripts/gold/run_gold_layer.sh` | 05c guard + 05d wired in both modes | Yes — `6223d2d9` |
| `infra/aws/ec2/EC2_MANIFEST.json` | Deploy recorded by safe-ec2-deploy.sh | Yes — `9bce21bd` |
| `org/tier2_senior/0.6.0_AE_PartnerETL/task_orders/ADVI_PSCFIX.A1.aua-certification-script.md` | status=complete | Yes (this commit) |

## Blockers

None.

## Current State

**Status:** COMPLETE
**Active branch:** `CLOUD`

`05d_write_aua_certification.py` is live in S3 (`s3://opal-data-bd/code/gold/`). EC2
will pick it up on the next gold pipeline boot. Script reads `silver/allocations/{date}.parquet`,
excludes 6 liability types (CreditCard, Mortgage, Loans, Insurance, TermLife, Annuity),
computes `certified_aua`, loads `gold/client_performance.parquet` for `gold_aua`, and
writes `gold/aua_certification/{date}.json`. Exits 0 on all paths. Wired in both
incremental and full modes after 05 (and after 05c when 05c is deployed). The publisher
Lambda can now consume the certification JSON on any day silver allocations are present.

---

## Next Steps

1. **[0.6.0_AE_PartnerETL] Complete ADVI_49FNV3.008** — write 05c_validate_aua_vs_silver.py
   (also assigned to this agent, still pending). 05d is wired to run after it.

2. **[0.4.0_DS_ClientPlatform] Implement publisher certification override** — per PRD
   Deliverables 2 & 3: load certification JSON in lambda_handler and override total_aua
   fields + scale NMNC/NMEC timeseries for current period.

3. **Verify in next pipeline run** — after EC2 boots and incremental run completes:
   ```
   aws s3 ls s3://opal-data-bd/gold/aua_certification/
   aws s3 cp s3://opal-data-bd/gold/aua_certification/2026-03-11.json -
   ```
   Confirm certified_aua ~1.599B, gold_aua ~1.605B, gap_pct ~-0.36%.

**Files to touch next:**
- `data/black_diamond/scripts/gold/05c_validate_aua_vs_silver.py` — write per ADVI_49FNV3.008

**Do NOT:**
- Use `run_script()` for 05c/05d in the runner — those helpers pass `--upload` which these scripts don't accept
- Write scripts directly on EC2 — all changes go repo -> S3 -> EC2 pull
