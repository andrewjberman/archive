<decomp_doc>org/missions/D5/ETFS/ETFS_RIVALS/decompositions/ETFS_RIVALS_DECOMP.md</decomp_doc> (round 27): the precondition of cell `RIV-tw-1`'s J1 read (a scheduled run that REACHES the enrichment leg needs a signed-in Terminal at 07:00 local; row Z-S79).
<owned_cells>RIV-tw-1</owned_cells>
</decomp_ref>

  <objective>
    Before 10:45Z on 2026-10-09, confirm the site-Z Bloomberg Terminal is signed in and reachable, and sign it in only if it
    is not, so the 11:00Z scheduled pulls can reach Bloomberg. Exactly one metered draw.
  </objective>

  <steps>
    Follow `integrations/bloomberg/READ_HERE.md` section 2, in this order, starting no earlier than 10:20Z:
    1. `bbg_credentials.py --check`.
    2. `bloomberg_health` (not a draw).
    3. ONE `reference_data` read: 1 security x 1 field, no other field. This IS a draw: record its security, field and time in
       the report. `2.0.0_SA_COO~Q1` books it on MDPF_DEMQUE as a tier-1 request the same day.
    4. ONLY if step 1, 2 or 3 fails: `bbg_signin.ps1 -Phase fill`, then `-Phase submit` only if still signed out; then
       repeat steps 2-3 once (a second draw, recorded the same way).
    If it is still not reachable after step 4, STOP and report. Do not retry further, and do not run any pull.
  </steps>

  <rules>
    No pull, no vehicle leg, no ad-hoc run of the 11:00Z job. No field beyond the one. Write only your deliverables folder and
    this order's report section.
  </rules>

<preflight>
comp-schedule: DECLARED-NOT-APPLICABLE this act triggers no schedule; it runs before the 11:00Z task and changes nothing about it.
comp-iam: DECLARED-NOT-APPLICABLE -- no AWS act.
comp-adversary: RUN -- a second draw by a retry loop: step 4 allows one repeat, then STOP; a health read taken as a sign-in proof: step 3's draw is the proof, health is not; a sign-in run while signed in: step 4 runs only on a failure. BLIND: whether the session holds from 10:45Z to 11:00Z.
lane: 0.7.0_AE_CloudOps~ZV, the site-Z lane for ETFS_RIVALS's site-bound acts (msg 1664).

  <report>
    Once, in this section, committed before 10:50Z, hash to `0.0.0_AB_MSTR~Z` so it reaches `0.0.0_AB_MSTR~DELL1`: each
    step's output line, whether a sign-in ran, the draw count (1 or 2) with security, field and time, and the measured push
    state. AC1 (the Terminal was reachable at the pre-flight) is the issuer's to grade.
