# Deploy Completion Record
**Date opened:** 2026-07-09T12:26:09.108694+00:00
**Status:** OPEN
**Deploy:** FRESHGUARD leg-4 finish: wire all 3 writers (derive_runner/incremental_updater/cse_store) to the centralized _provenance.stamp_marker so per-table last_write_iso lands live. GROUNDED: leg-4 is SOURCE-INCOMPLETE (unwired), not merely undeployed -- the centralized stamp has ZERO call sites; all 3 writers stamp their own local marker with no last_write_iso field. HELD on CTO approach-gate (A centralize-import vs B 3-copy).
**Authored by:** 0.7.0_AE_CloudOps
**Class:** deploy-completion (NEVER-law gate e38cc2b16; contract tool .tools/deploy_ledger.py, TO #5)
**Window:** 4.0h (OPEN past window -> RED COO alarm via `deploy_ledger.py check --red`)
