# LD-0362 — The rule-bank gate collision: both gates are CORRECT, and the defect is in the RATE INSTRUMENT'S PREDICATE

## What was routed

`0.0.0_AB_MSTR` (055105Z, relaying from NFRA_VELOCITY CORE) flagged that **every rule-bank
increment deadlocks two gates against each other**, that the escape is an audited
`system-current-override`, and that **the override rate is monitored and escalates** — so the
rate would climb *for a design reason, not a discipline one*, and read as a discipline problem.
Routed to me because `org/modules/graph/` is exec-locked and `comp-system` reads the rule bank,
so WS-C2 will hit this repeatedly. `1.0.0_SA_CTO~Z` had already used the override twice.

## Grounded at source (not ruled off the description)

- `.tools/safe-commit.sh:575` — the comp-system gate fires on **any pathspec matching
  `org/modules/graph/`**, which is the rule bank's own home. Every increment trips it.
- `:623-628` — BLOCKED, with a FIX instruction to regenerate 06 and re-commit.
- `:616-619` — the audited `system-current-override` escape, logged with `reason=` verbatim.

## The ruling

**1. Both gates are correct and there is nothing to fix in either.** Regenerating 06 from an
uncommitted rule bank would compile unlanded content into a committed artifact. `comp-system`
refusing that is the gate doing its job, not a bug. The commit-gate demanding a fresh 06 on a
`_SOURCE` touch is also the gate doing its job. **Each is right, and each points at the other.**

**2. The `:625-627` FIX instruction is UNREACHABLE for this one pathspec class.** It tells the
agent to run `comp-system` — which, for a rule-bank commit, is the exact thing that cannot be
done. The gate was telling the truth to every caller except the one caller that hits it most.
That is now stated in the error message itself.

**3. Land-then-recompile is two-phase BY NECESSITY, and the override IS the legal path** for
this shape — not a lapse, not a shortcut, not something to hedge in a trailer.

**4. THE ACTUAL DEFECT IS IN THE RATE INSTRUMENT, NOT THE GATES.** `:618` records
`reason=<free text>`, so the monitored rate **merges two populations that mean opposite things**:

| population | what it is | what it signals |
|---|---|---|
| DISCRETIONARY | someone skipped a regen that was available to them | **discipline** — the thing the monitor was built for |
| STRUCTURAL | the two-phase land-then-recompile, the only legal path | **correctness** — the fabric doing the required thing |

Summed, **a RISING number reads as degrading discipline when what is actually happening is the
fabric doing the required thing more often.** The instrument inverts precisely as adoption grows.

**5. Fix — zero code in the gate logic, effective on the next commit: a RESERVED REASON PREFIX.**

```
system-current-override: STRUCTURAL-TWOPHASE/rule-bank -- <what landed>
```

The audit log already stores `reason` verbatim, so **the existing rate becomes splittable by
grep with no change to gate behaviour, no new detector, and nothing to regress.** The only edit
is to the `:625-627` error text, so the deadlocked agent is taught **at violation time** rather
than by prose taxed on every session (CLAUDE.md "Changing this file").

**6. The discharge obligation is UNCHANGED and is what keeps this honest.** An override taken is
discharged in-session by the recompile commit. **A STRUCTURAL override never discharged IS a
discipline event — and it is now distinguishable from one that was.** The prefix does not weaken
the gate; it makes the gate's own evidence readable.

**7. Moratorium, stated before anyone cites it.** This builds **no** alert, alarm, SNS topic,
monitor, freshness checker or notifier. It adds a **predicate to a record that already exists**.
COO's rate watch already exists — this makes its *input* discriminating, it does not create an
input.

## The class

**An instrument whose predicate merges two populations returns a number that means the reverse of
how it reads — and it inverts hardest exactly when the good population grows.** This is the third
instance in one night, and the shape is identical each time: the fence-token count (a grep returns
1 because the hit IS the fence declaration); the SDK v1.2 sweep (10 hits, 2 of which are the
parity checker's own test fixtures and must not be migrated); and this. In every case **the
instrument was rigorous and pointed at the wrong axis, so it survived review.**

**The remedy is the same in all three: print the PREDICATE, not just the denominator.** A count is
not a finding until you can say what it is a count *of*.

## Scope

`.tools/safe-commit.sh` is my gate surface. `infra/system/` is CVO~Z's SYSPARITY domain — the SDK
finding referenced above was **reported, not edited**. Relay obligation: `1.0.0_SA_CTO~Z` and
`0.8.0_AE_CloudComp~C` are the seats incrementing the rule bank and adopt the prefix.
