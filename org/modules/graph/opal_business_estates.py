"""opal_business_estates -- the OPAL BUSINESS-SEMANTIC estate traversal engine.

Tool: `comp-semantic-estates`. Replaces the bare-named `pipescript` and its `pipescript_cli.py` engine,
which are DEPRECATED (Andrew-direct 2026-07-29: "we are deprecating base pipescript. there is
comp-pipescript only for future reference" / "pipescript needs to be categorically renamed as
comp-semantic-estates, and if you need a name for the script itself say opal_business_estates").

=== WHAT WAS BROKEN, AND WHY A WRAPPER COULD NOT FIX IT ===

The predecessor answered "what is in the <name> thread?" out of a GENERATED SNAPSHOT
(estate-coverage-resolver.json) whose served-artifact and S3-key strings are FROZEN AT GENERATION.
The snapshot is both the claim and the yardstick, so the tool structurally could not report its own
staleness -- and a stale estate map does not fail quietly, it ACTIVELY DEFENDS ZOMBIES.

Measured instance (2026-07-23): it named the pre-revamp key
    platinum/mdpf/aggregate_aua_timeseries.json      described as "LIVE fresh"
while the live serve was
    json/mdpf/global/aggregate-aua-timeseries.json
and it listed a RETIRED freshness-checker as a live producer. That mis-scoped a live key chase.

A vintage BANNER (the previous fix) makes that loud. It does not make it CORRECT. The number was
still wrong; the reader was just warned. This engine fixes the mechanism instead:

    THE SNAPSHOT IS THE *NAMING* LAYER ONLY. KEYS ARE RESOLVED LIVE FROM SOURCE.

Thread names, membership and human structure still come from the snapshot -- that is what it is
good for, and it carries no better alternative. But every S3 key is re-derived from the working
tree at call time, and the two are DIFFED. A snapshot key that no longer appears in any producer is
reported as STALE-IN-SNAPSHOT rather than served as fact. That is the exact defect above, converted
from an invisible wrong answer into a printed finding.

=== WHAT IT DOES NOT CLAIM ===
This is the BRIDGE, not the destination. The destination is comp-kuzu canonical (base CTO
163950Z). Live-from-source is strictly better than frozen-in-snapshot and strictly worse than the
canonical graph: it sees the repo, not the deployed estate, so a deployed-but-diverged artifact is
outside it. That limit is printed, not implied.

=== CONTRACTS ===
1. SOURCE-TIMESTAMP HEAD, FAIL-LOUD. Substrate + vintage on line 1 of every invocation. If a
   substrate cannot be named, print an explicit SOURCE UNRESOLVABLE and exit 2 -- never proceed
   silently. There is no bare `except: pass` in that path. (The predecessor's banner sat in exactly
   that construct, so a corrupt resolver printed NO header at all -- and a tool with no header
   reads as a tool with NO SOURCE, not as a failed read.)
2. --refresh IS A BRIDGE. It regenerates the snapshot and every run still says the substrate is not
   canonical. Refresh makes it NEWER, never CANONICAL.

Read-only. --refresh writes exactly one file: the snapshot it regenerates.
