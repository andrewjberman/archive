# NFRA_OPSEC202609 -- surprise channel, ADJUDICATION v1 (round 2, site Z)

**Home:** the project tree's adjudication document (`org/ref/SURPRISE_CHANNEL_PROTOCOL.md` section 4a; lane `TREE_CVO`).
**Who writes:** `3.0.0_SA_CVO~Z`, and only the CVO. Round 1's CVO rows were `Z-S19`/`Z-S20` in the investigation
document, before the coordinate existed; round 2's carry `NFRA_OPSEC202609-Z-C-S<k>`, `k` restarting at 1 here.

**Round 2 L8/L9 read (packet `@4cef4a058c`, 2026-09-10 ~02:4xZ):** L8 COMPILATION IS THIS SEAT'S LIMB -- the spine's
section 1 reads *"L8 -- Compilation. Owner: `3.0.0_SA_CVO`, WHOSE ENGAGEMENT WITH THE PROJECT BEGINS HERE"*, and rule 27
was corrected to match at `f5355fcfc4` after stating L9. So the packet's arithmetic is **verified here, not accepted**.

**THIS DOCUMENT CARRIES, AT THIS WRITE: the L8 compile verification and the round's TWO JUDGMENT GRADES.** The 138
undispositioned investigation items are the L10 precondition and are dispositioned in a later append to this same
document; **L10 is NOT reachable on this write and nothing here claims it is.**

## C-S1 -- the L8 COMPILE, verified on this seat's own instruments, including a limb the packet did not claim

THE DISCRIMINATING LIMB, and the lane was right that it cannot be argued from source: the DEPLOYED bundle of opal-session-analytics (CodeSha256 66qB33r/6QF+jkb/lcrSbRD+, LastModified 2026-09-09T21:26:02Z, 22,584 bytes, ONE member dist/index.mjs, 70,108 chars scanned) carries 'JWT public key secret is empty' ONCE, 'JWT public key envelope has no usable' ONCE, and the TTL literal 300000 ONCE. A second hand-rolled cache would reproduce Z-S155 and would show these literals twice. It shows them once. PASS. Probing the bundle on LITERALS rather than identifiers is also the correct instrument here -- a bun-bundled artifact mangles identifiers, so an identifier probe would have proved nothing either way."

The two are NOT alternatives -- the criterion's wording offers them as a choice and they answer different questions. The deciding argument is the failure DIRECTION: a bounded cache fails toward MORE invalidation, which the system already absorbs; a runbook step fails SILENTLY toward retaining a key that should have been invalidated, which is the exact state a rotation exists to eliminate.",

Verified at source (jwt.ts:145-156): getMfaCodeSealKey caches with no time component; the docstring states the consequence, the non-regression and what is weakened. THE RULING THE CRITERION RESERVES: BOUND THE CACHE, to a window no longer than the private key's. Reasoning -- (a) the divergence exists ONLY because the derived value is cached forever: getMfaCodeSealKey already calls getJwtPrivateKey(), which IS now bounded, so a cache miss already yields the current key and bounding converges automatically. (b) THE FAILURE DIRECTIONS ARE NOT SYMMETRIC. A bounded cache that refreshes spuriously at a TTL boundary costs a lapsed resend-idempotency, and the cell's own limb 5 establishes that path is already graceful -- unsealCode returns null, mfa.ts mints a replacement code, hashCode verification is untouched. A missed runbook step retains a seal key derived from a rotated-away private key, silently, with nothing observable distinguishing 'step performed' from 'step forgotten'. This estate's own doctrine settles that: a missed gate is worse than a phantom one, and only one of the two errors announces itself. (c) THE LABEL BUMP IS NOT THEREBY RETIRED -- it remains the correct lever when invalidation must be IMMEDIATE and TOTAL rather than within one TTL (a suspected compromise), which bounding cannot deliver. RULING THE FORK AS EXCLUSIVE WOULD HAVE DISCARDED A CAPABILITY: 'bound OR bump' is a false dichotomy the criterion's wording invites, and naming that is part of the answer."
