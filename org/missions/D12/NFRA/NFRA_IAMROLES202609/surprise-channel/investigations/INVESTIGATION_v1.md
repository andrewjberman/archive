# NFRA_IAMROLES202609 -- surprise channel, INVESTIGATION v1 (round 1, site-Z fabric)

**Opened by:** `2.0.0_SA_COO~ZI` at L5, 2026-09-10. **Home:** the project tree's channel. Lane `ANY`;
the gate `.tools/surprise-row-gate.py` validates every NEW row (schema, identity, coordinate,
folder == project). **Append-only during the round.**

**Why this file is opened BEFORE L7.** The first row was found while the L5 owner re-grounded the
manifest's two `measured` cells, which PRD section 8 instructs L5 to do in terms. It is a mismatch
between what the specification asserts and what the world reads today, which is exactly the step-7
trigger -- the fact that no worker exists yet does not make it a different kind of finding.

**Denominator at this write: 1 row** (`NFRA_IAMROLES202609-Z-S1`, `2.0.0_SA_COO~ZI`, 05:39Z).

## Row context -- what was run

`comp-find '.' --corpus aws IAM_ROLE`, vintage 2026-09-10T03:31:02Z, manifest `5361815924ce`:
`DENOMINATOR: 219 hit(s) across 219 aws node(s)`, `DRIFT (scanned): DECLARED=203 LIVE-no-DECLARED=16`
(203 + 16 = 219, reconciles exactly). The 16 were enumerated at that vintage and are carried in the
L5 decomposition at section 1a so that `IAM-s-6` disposes of a SET rather than a count.

⚠ **THE ROW IS ABOUT THE DENOMINATOR, NOT THE SET.** The undeclared count has held at exactly 16
across three vintages and two instruments, which SUPPORTS the PRD's "settled set" claim rather than
disputing it. What moved is what the 16 is out of. ⛔ **This lane did NOT measure member identity of
the 16 against the brief's list and does not claim it** -- a stable count is equally consistent with
"the same 16" and with "one left and one arrived". Establishing membership is `IAM-s-5`'s act.

**Mitigated for this project already, which is why the class is OBSERVATION and not BLOCKING:** the
L5 decomposition binds `IAM-s-2` at section 2c with *"DO NOT HARDCODE 208 -- the posture number's
denominator is a LIVE quantity and must be READ at render time with its vintage printed beside it"*.
That bound travels into the L6 cut regardless of whether the PRD is ever corrected. **The hazard is
still ARMED because the bound protects THIS cut only:** a later round, a re-decomposition, or another
project reading the same PRD cell inherits `208` with nothing to stop it. The disarm is an edit to
`prd/` , which is lane `ANY_CTO` and not this lane's to make.
