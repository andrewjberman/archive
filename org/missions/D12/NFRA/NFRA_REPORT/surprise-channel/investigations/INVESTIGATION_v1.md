# NFRA_REPORT -- surprise channel, INVESTIGATION v1 (round 1, site-Z fabric)

**Home:** the project tree's channel (`org/standards/PROJECT_TREE.contract.json` `surprise_channel_glob`);
the gate `.tools/surprise-row-gate.py` validates every NEW row (schema
`org/surprise_channel/schemas/investigation_item.schema.json`, identity, folder == project, the allocator
coordinate). Lane `ANY`.
**Id grammar (site-Z fabric):** a worker's row is `NFRA_REPORT-Z-W<n>-S<k>` (`<n>` = its slot, `<k>` next
unused within that coordinate); a seat's row is `NFRA_REPORT-Z-S<k>`; the CVO's adjudication rows live in
`../adjudications/` as `NFRA_REPORT-Z-C-S<k>`. **Append-only during the round.** Never edit an existing row.
**This file opened by** `0.9.0_WK_NFRA_REPORT~2` at `RP-s-5` (`TO-RP-s-5`) -- the first rows in this
project's channel. Denominator at this write: **3 rows**, all `~2`'s (`S1`, `S2`, `S3`).

NOT a request to reopen RP-s-1: that order is terminal, its instance VALID, and reopening an accepted certified cell is a rewind. The repair lives forward. Sharpened by the same seat's disarm of NFRA_REPORT-Z-W2-S2 at a535ae513e, which ADDED a mandatory rendered UNGROUPED value to FWD-4's attribution axis -- so the uncovered limb has since grown a new required value that no cell is positioned to build."
