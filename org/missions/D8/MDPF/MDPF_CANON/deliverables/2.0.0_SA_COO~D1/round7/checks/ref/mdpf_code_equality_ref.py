"""MDPF runner code equality -- read-only comparison of the runner's code prefixes with the repo.

WHAT IT COMPARES. The MDPF daily runner pulls its code from the code prefixes of the opal-data-mdpf bucket with two
aws s3 sync --delete lines in infra/aws/ec2/mdpf-daily-runner/mdpf-daily-dispatch.sh. This tool compares, file by file,
every runner code tree with its repo home: the script trees declared in CODE_TREES for the runner's product key (the layers that are not
shared repo homes), and the config tree (repo home data/mdpf/config; its S3 prefix is read from the dispatch script's
config sync line, never typed here). Four script trees and one config tree: five trees.

HOW EQUALITY IS DECIDED. A local file is EQUAL when the S3 object of the same relative name has an ETag equal to the
md5 of the bytes git HAS RECORDED for it (the index blob, `git show :<path>`, the same source safe-deploy uploads); only a
path with no index entry is read from the working tree. A named EQUAL line states its basis, "(blob)" or "(worktree)",
and a blob-EQUAL name whose working copy carries CR bytes also prints that count as a fact (worktree_cr=N). A multipart
ETag (it contains a dash) is UNDETERMINED and is never EQUAL. A local file with no S3 object is MISSING_ON_S3; an S3
object with no local file is EXTRA_ON_S3; any other pair is DIFFER.

WHAT IT NEVER DOES. It never repairs, copies, uploads, deletes or moves anything. Its only AWS calls are list reads
(boto3, default credential chain, region us-east-1). A DIFFER, MISSING_ON_S3 or EXTRA_ON_S3 name is a fact about the
tree, not an instruction. A repo file that is not a runner member (a test, a QA tool, a file a bundle ships) is
expected to read that way. Equality of the whole tree is not a goal; named files EQUAL is the goal of a deploy act.

MODES. No arguments: one TREE table per tree (with its names), then one summary line. --files REPO_PATH ...: grades
only the named files; the trees that hold them are printed, then one NAMED line per name, then the summary line.
Summary denominators: files = distinct relative names across the local and S3 sides of the trees shown, so
equal + not_equal = files; under --files, named = the names given and named_not_equal = those not EQUAL.

EXIT CODES. 0 = the run completed (whole-tree mode, or under --files every named file EQUAL). 1 = under --files at
least one named file is not EQUAL. 2 = REFUSED: a named file is under no runner code tree, the dispatch script's prefix
lines are unreadable or ambiguous, or the S3 read failed; in each case nothing is compared and nothing is written.
