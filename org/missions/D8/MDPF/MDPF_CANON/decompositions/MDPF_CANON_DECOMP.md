**Author:** `2.0.0_SA_COO~D1` (dell1), seated by `0.0.0_AB_MSTR~DELL1` msg 2979. **Input:**
- PRD v2.9 (ENDPOINT, CONTRACTS, DEC-1..15, CELL CANDIDATES M1-M17, PATHS, SURFACE MANIFEST);
- the L5 fact sheet;
- the CTO's L5 ruling (a), the per-firm gold writer (msg 2995);
- the CVO's L6 condition (msg 3000).

## Round 1 -- THE THREAD (FWD-1)

FWD-1's journey has four hops:
1. A figure is computed (the existing gold Lambda).
2. It is written as dated parquet where the naming rule puts it: the firm bucket for a firm, the product bucket for the composite.
3. Its history is there, one partition per date.
4. Someone answers "what did 49 Financial's total assets read on a day last month" from the stored file's name alone.

Hop 1 is served and has no cell. Hop 4 is the issuer's real run at close: list `address()`'s partitions and answer from the key's date.

| cell | hop | serves (cell_refs) | candidate | owned files | depends on | actor |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `CN-a-1` the per-firm gold writers (WORLD) | 2 (who may write) | FWD-1 (and FWD-6's fence-untouched clause) | PRD v2.9 "the firm gold writer" | `infra/aws/terraform/mdpf-pipeline/iam.tf`, `gold-lambda.tf` | -- | ~1 (worker) |
| `CN-a-2` the one parquet writer (WORLD) | 2 (what is written, where) | FWD-1 | M2, M16 | `mdpf_gold_parquet.py` (new), `mdpf_gold_consolidator.py`, its test, `build_package.py` | -- | ~2 (worker) |
| `CN-a-3` the backfill (WORLD) | 3 (the history) | FWD-1 | M3 | `mdpf_gold_backfill.py` (new), `mdpf_gold_consolidator.py`, its test, `build_package.py` | `CN-a-2` | ~3 (worker) |

**Chains:**
- Chain 1 is `CN-a-1`.
- Chain 2 is `CN-a-2` -> `CN-a-3`; they share the consolidator and the package list, so they run in sequence.

**Fan-out:** 2 of 2 chains, cap 8; `CN-a-3` is cut in the same issuance and spawned when `CN-a-2` completes.

**Deploy order at the drain** (CloudOps, `safe-apply`, never by a worker):
1. `CN-a-1`'s IAM.
2. The gold Lambda package with `CN-a-2` and `CN-a-3`.
3. One ad-hoc QA invocation of the daily path.
4. One `run_class=backfill` invocation.

The scheduled 13:30Z floor is the confirmation, never the proof.

**Checks:** `deliverables/2.0.0_SA_COO~D1/round1/checks/`:

| check | at base | against the reference tree |
|---|---|---|
| `r1_iam.py` | 2 of 6 (ADMITTED passes live) | -- |
| `r1_emit.py` | 0 of 7 | 7 of 7 |
| `r1_backfill.py` | 0 of 7 | 7 of 7 |

**Not in round 1:**
- M1 (the census) and M7 (the basis) wait on nothing and open round 2.
- M4-M6, M8 and M11-M17 follow the PRD's arc.
- M9 and M10 wait per firm on ADVI_FIRMBKTS (at PRD).
- The publisher (M5) cannot read parquet as deployed (python3.12, no pyarrow layer; L5_FACTS section 4). That is a packaging decision for its round.
- `demo` has no writer and no object anywhere (L5_FACTS section 1), so no cell writes it.

**Known red at base, not this project's:** three `test_global_fold_flag2.py` cases fail at box/dell1 (filed as row MDPF_CANON-D1-S1);
the regression criterion deselects exactly those three by node id.
