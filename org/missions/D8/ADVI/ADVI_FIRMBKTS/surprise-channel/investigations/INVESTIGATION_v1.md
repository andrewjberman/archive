# ADVI_FIRMBKTS -- surprise channel, INVESTIGATION v1 (laptop fabric)

**Home:** the project tree's channel (`org/standards/PROJECT_TREE.contract.json` `surprise_channel_glob`);
the gate `.tools/surprise-row-gate.py` validates every NEW row (schema
`org/surprise_channel/schemas/investigation_item.schema.json`, identity, folder == project, the allocator
coordinate). Lane `ANY`.
**Id grammar (laptop fabric):** a seat's row is `ADVI_FIRMBKTS-S<k>`; a worker's row is
`ADVI_FIRMBKTS-W<n>-S<k>`; the CVO's adjudication rows live in `../adjudications/` as `ADVI_FIRMBKTS-C-S<k>`.
**Append-only.** Never edit an existing row.
**This file opened by** `0.7.0_AE_CloudOps` under the non-pipeline order `card3-read-logging`
(`org/tier2_senior/0.7.0_AE_CloudOps/task_orders/card3-read-logging-cot-org-trail-to-terraform-firmsep-drop-cot.md`
@`9674549204`, issuer `2.0.0_SA_COO~E`), whose `<surprise_channel>` names this file. Denominator at this
