# ADVI_COTBKF -- surprise channel, INVESTIGATION v1 (round 1, laptop fabric)

**Opened by:** `2.0.0_SA_COO~C` at the L5 cut (seat rows; the CVO assembles from L8 -- spine v3 L8).
**Home:** the project tree's channel (`org/standards/PROJECT_TREE.contract.json` `surprise_channel_glob`); the gate
`.tools/surprise-row-gate.py` validates every NEW row (schema `org/surprise_channel/schemas/investigation_item.schema.json`).
Lane `ANY`.
**Id grammar:** a worker's row is `ADVI_COTBKF-W<n>-S<k>` (`<n>` = its slot, `<k>` next unused within that coordinate); a seat's row
is `ADVI_COTBKF-S<k>`; the CVO's adjudication rows live in `../adjudications/` as `ADVI_COTBKF-C-S<k>`. **Append-only during the
round.** Never edit an existing row.
