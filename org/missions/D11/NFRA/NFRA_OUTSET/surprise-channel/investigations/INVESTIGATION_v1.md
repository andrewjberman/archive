# NFRA_OUTSET -- surprise channel, INVESTIGATION v1 (round 1, laptop fabric)

**Home:** the project tree's channel (`org/standards/PROJECT_TREE.contract.json` `surprise_channel_glob`); the gate
`.tools/surprise-row-gate.py` validates every NEW row (schema, identity, folder == project). Lane `ANY` -- the seat
that sees a divergence appends its own row and keeps working (CLAUDE.md s.2).
**First appends:** worker `0.9.0_WK_NFRA_OUTSET~1` on `NFRA_OUTSET.TO-OS-s-1` (Rule T budget wiring across
`.tools/comp-heat`'s five subcommands). This file did not exist before this worker's write; created here.

## What this worker measured, filed as five rows below

- **S1** -- `O1-AC2`'s own `<expect>` ("WITHIN BUDGET" at `freshness .tools --budget 5`) is contradicted by a
  reproducible, measured runtime: the underlying engine (`org/modules/heatmap/object_freshness.py`) always scans
  the WHOLE repository regardless of the scoped path (OS-s-2's own target, `depends_on: OS-s-1`, still open), and
  that whole-repo scan measures 6.2-11.7s across seven independent runs on this box -- never under 5s. An honest
  Rule T implementation therefore reports `BUDGET REACHED`, not `WITHIN BUDGET`, at the criterion's own invocation.
- **S2** -- `comp-heat federated`'s refuse-before-dispatch guard, if built as a bare elapsed-time check (`_spent()`
  alone, mirroring the other four subcommands), is a RACE that fails to fire for a tiny `--budget`: with nothing
  bounded between resolving the budget and the dispatch decision, `Clock.remaining()` has not yet decayed to zero
  even for `--budget 0.0001`, so the naive guard would let a live ~3-4 minute Trino call through. Found and fixed
  in this worker's own draft before any commit (a second, budget_s-based floor check now gates dispatch,
  `FEDERATED_LIVE_FLOOR_S = 200.0`); filed because the same trap is live for OS-s-5 (`comp-heat federated --sql`,
  `depends_on: OS-s-1`), and because `.tools/_trino_fed.py` -- the only place the live call's OWN duration could be
  genuinely bounded -- sits outside this order's `<paths>` write grant, so the fix here is a wrapper-level mitigation,
  not a full cure.
- **S3** -- while building the Rule T "reconciled denominator" for `freshness`, this worker measured that
  `object_freshness.py`'s `tracked_last_write()` silently drops 10 of 30,276 currently-tracked paths (they never
  appear in the `git log --name-only` walk this worktree produces) -- a pre-existing engine characteristic, not
  introduced by this order and not investigated further (out of OS-s-1's scope).
- **S4** -- the issuing harness's own instruction named the proof-of-spec instance filename as
  `NFRA_OUTSET.TO-OS-s-1.rule-t-budget-across-comp-heat.proof_of_spec.json`; the task order file's own
  `<proof_of_spec>` block names `NFRA_OUTSET.TO-OS-s-1.proof_of_spec.json` (no descriptive suffix) at the same
  commit. This worker used the harness-given (longer, descriptive) name, matching the TO's own filename
  convention, and records the discrepancy rather than silently picking one.
- **S5** -- `.tools/safe-commit.sh`'s `comp-system-gate` WS-2 staleness check BLOCKED the first commit attempt of
  this order's code (`.tools/comp-heat` matches its trigger grep `\.tools/comp-`; `infra/system/06_current_state.*`
  is stale against comp-heat's new Rule T fields), and the file that check's own FIX path names
  (`infra/system/06_current_state.{md,json}`) is outside this order's `<paths>` write grant. Used the gate's own
  sanctioned `system-current-override: <reason>` `-F`-file trailer (not the STRUCTURAL-TWOPHASE prefix -- this is
  not a rule-bank touch) instead of widening the lane.
