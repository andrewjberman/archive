## THE CELL

OS-s-3 (PRD s.7): `comp-which "what is comp-heat"` returns NO CURATED RULE MATCHED across 79 tools ranked, top score 0.36.

## DELIVERABLE

`org/missions/D11/NFRA/NFRA_OUTSET/deliverables/0.9.0_WK_NFRA_OUTSET~1/router-rule-for-a-heat-question.result.md` -- the result document: what you measured, what you changed, each criterion's invocation and its output verbatim with rc and denominator, and any row you filed.

## ACCEPTANCE

One clause per criterion. A mechanical criterion carries exactly one `<invocation>` and one `<expect>`, so its pass is decided by the MATCH and never by your opinion. A `judgment="true"` criterion is RECORDED with its evidence and NO verdict -- `3.0.0_SA_CVO` grades it at L9, and a PASS or FAIL written on one is INVALID.

<criterion id="O3-AC1" cell_refs="OS-s-3"><invocation>.tools/comp-which "what is stale and safe to archive"</invocation><expect>comp-heat</expect></criterion>
`O3-AC1` -- the question routes to comp-heat rather than NO CURATED RULE MATCHED.

<criterion id="O3-AC2" cell_refs="OS-s-3"><invocation>.tools/comp-which "what have I not touched in months"</invocation><expect>comp-heat</expect></criterion>
`O3-AC2` -- a second phrasing of the same question routes the same way.

<criterion id="O3-AC3" cell_refs="OS-s-3"><invocation>python .tools/comp-which-routing-test.py</invocation><expect>PASS</expect></criterion>
`O3-AC3` -- the routing battery still passes with the new rule -- the baseline is UPDATED, never broken.

<expected_criteria>O3-AC1, O3-AC2, O3-AC3</expected_criteria>

## BOUNDS

- **Your write surface is the `<paths>` block below and nothing else.** A path you need that it does not name is a CUT DEFECT: file a BLOCKING row and stop that criterion. It is never an override.
- **EVERY invocation is bounded.** You run each under `timeout 120` and a timeout is RECORDED AS THE OUTPUT -- so an unbounded command yields a criterion whose evidence is the word "timeout". Use a tool's own `--budget`/`--limit`; never name a whole-corpus sweep.
- **No new dependency. No second implementation.** PRD s.5 is out of scope and truthful non-application is not work.
- **NEVER-AUTO-DELETE (PRD R-5, absolute):** nothing is removed by a tool; a candidate list is advisory.
- **No alarm, monitor, freshness-checker or SNS** (standing moratorium).
- **A spec-vs-world divergence is a ROW** at `org/missions/D11/NFRA/NFRA_OUTSET/surprise-channel/investigations/INVESTIGATION_v1.md`, minted `NFRA_OUTSET-W<n>-S<k>` for a worker (`<n>` = your slot) and `NFRA_OUTSET-S<k>` for a seat -- append, cite `path@commit`, never edit an existing row, keep working.
- **NEVER `git push`**, under this or any order. Report push state as MEASURED (`git ls-remote`).

<preflight>
comp-schedule: RUN at the issuance -- the gate ledger read once for this issuance and quoted in the issuance commit; 0 armed gates name NFRA_OUTSET, comp-heat or the estate-report runner.
comp-iam: DECLARED-NOT-APPLICABLE for a repo-surface cell (no principal, policy or resource is read or changed); ON OS-s-6 and OS-s-7 it is the cell's own instrument and is RUN there.
comp-adversary: DECLARED-NOT-APPLICABLE -- this order is a FRESH CUT with no prior artifact to validate against; comp-adversary composes a validator-context declaration for an existing deliverable, and the first artifact this cell produces is the one it would read. It is the ASSIGNEE's instrument at report time, not the issuer's at cut.
lane: the `<paths>` block above IS the grant (RULING 1, Andrew 2026-09-04 ~04:58Z) -- a worker serial is admitted to exactly these paths while this order is NON-TERMINAL at HEAD, and to its own deliverables folder by the tree convention.
</preflight>

<proof_of_spec>
Criterion ids minted at cut by the issuer: `O3-AC1`, `O3-AC2`, `O3-AC3`. The ASSIGNEE fills a `PROOF_OF_SPEC.schema.json` instance at
`org/missions/D11/NFRA/NFRA_OUTSET/deliverables/0.9.0_WK_NFRA_OUTSET~1/NFRA_OUTSET.TO-OS-s-3.router-rule-for-a-heat-question.proof_of_spec.json`
and validates it with `python .tools/proof-of-spec-check.py <instance> O3-AC1,O3-AC2,O3-AC3` BEFORE the complete flip, which the assignee commits itself.
⛔ **A `complete` flip WITHDRAWS YOUR OWN GRANT** (the grant is read from a NON-TERMINAL order): flip only when every MECHANICAL criterion PASSES. A mis-flip is REOPENED by the issuer, never re-cut.
</proof_of_spec>

**REPORT:** your FINAL MESSAGE, once, in the `WORKER REPORT` shape (serial / TO / branch / HEAD; BLOCKING; CRITERIA with each invocation and its deciding line; PROOF with rc; ROWS; COMMITS; NEXT). You cannot send or receive messages -- anything you would ask is a surprise row.
