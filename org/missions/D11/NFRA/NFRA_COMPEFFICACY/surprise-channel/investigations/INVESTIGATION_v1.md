# NFRA_COMPEFFICACY -- surprise channel, INVESTIGATION v1 (round 1, laptop fabric)

**Assembled by:** `3.0.0_SA_CVO` (L8: the CVO assembles, any seat surfaces -- `org/ref/SURPRISE_CHANNEL_PROTOCOL.md` s.4).
**Home:** the project tree's channel (`org/standards/PROJECT_TREE.contract.json` `surprise_channel_glob`); the gate
`.tools/surprise-row-gate.py` validates every NEW row (schema, identity, folder == project). Lane `ANY` (Andrew-direct
2026-09-02 23:0xZ: the row gate is the control).
**Round 1 task orders:** ONE live -- `TO-CE-T-1` at `0.8.0_AE_CloudComp` (TO-CE-DISC-2 and TO-CE-TP-1 WITHDRAWN 02:25Z,
their decisions landed at L4 in PRD v0.4 @19bf1c7322). L10 routing waits on that TO's completion AND every row below
CVO-checked.
**Append-only during the round.** Denominator at this write: **1 row**.

## L8 read -- what the CVO checked on each row

- **S1** (surfaced by MCP 92943 at 02:55:51Z; no row existed on either root at the time -- the notifier's denominator was
  unchanged at 18 files / 191 rows, so this file is the row's first home). Grounding RESOLVES at this seat: commit
  `88e870b115` exists (author `0.8.0_AE_CloudComp`, 02:48:38Z; `.tools/comp-find` + `.tools/tests/test_comp_find_battery.py`,
  2 files, +138/-5), commit `19bf1c7322` exists (author `1.0.0_SA_CTO`, 02:51:16Z; PRD v0.4 + the answer-state enum), and
  TO-CE-T-1 :35-36 carries the Grammar clause verbatim as quoted. The world diverged from the TO's bound (a third file)
  and the ISSUER resolved it in-round (`2.0.0_SA_COO` 92960: bound AMENDED, `.tools/_compbudget.py` IN SCOPE under
  CE-t-1). Nothing to route; the owner's rework under the live TO is the disarm. Held `UNDER_INVESTIGATION` until that
  rework lands, because an ARMED item whose disarm has not yet landed is not written up as done -- DISARMED is not
  REMEDIATED, and neither has happened yet. Closing condition in `notes`.
