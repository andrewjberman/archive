comp-schedule: DECLARED-NOT-APPLICABLE no schedule, cron or trigger is added or moved by this cell (the backfill is ad hoc by Andrew's word and is run by the issuer, never scheduled)
comp-iam: DECLARED-NOT-APPLICABLE no IAM grant, role or policy changes in this cell (the chart objects sit under the page prefix the publisher already writes and the gateway already reads)
comp-adversary: DECLARED-NOT-APPLICABLE the validator-context composer profiles RETURNED work for the L8/L9 packet; at the cut nothing is returned, and the issuer's evidence context is this order's check files

**Project:** ETFS_RIVALS (D5/ETFS, fabric site-z) -- *rivalfunds*: a daily research page on rival active ETFs (13 funds, two peer groups): rankings, buying trend, AI accounts per fund, a security dialog per holding, and a separate audit page; published to S3 by the package `data/etfs/scripts/rivalfunds/` (five AWS stage Lambdas) and served signed-in by the opal-gateway. **Round 15** (PRD v0.18 FWD-22, FWD-23): every period becomes 30 / 90 / 365 calendar days; the security dialog gains a price curve with the fund's buys and sells marked on it, fed by a per-fund chart object behind one gateway route and drawn by the page's one script; a Bloomberg close-price backfill is built (never run by a worker). Nothing here deploys, merges or calls a vendor (stub every OpenAI and Bloomberg hook). Work ONLY in the worktree your spawn line names; every path below is relative to that root.

## 1. YOUR CELL (inlined verbatim from the decomposition)

Shared vocabulary (binding on every cell):
- **Periods:** `R30`, `R90`, `R365` -- calendar days. `asof = prev_trading_day(page_day)` (the existing CALL 3 rule); a window's
  first day is `asof - N calendar days`, its last day `asof`. `MTD`, `QTD`, `YTD` keep computing and are never displayed.
- **Chart object:** one JSON per fund per page day at `homes.page(<day>, "charts/<FUND>.json")` (opal_naming output), shape
  `{"fund", "asof", "generated_at", "ranges": {"R30": <first day>, "R90": ..., "R365": ...}, "securities": {<security_key>:
  {"name", "source_words", "points": [[<YYYY-MM-DD>, <price>|null, <source code>], ...], "gaps": [{"start", "end", "reason"}],
  "markers": [{"side": "buy"|"sell", "start", "end", "span": bool, "usd", "bps", "r", "n_trades"}]}}}`. Source codes:
  `m` market close, `i` holding-implied. `points` ascend by date and cover `asof - 365d .. asof`.
- **Route:** `GET /rivalfunds/<YYYY-MM-DD>/chart/<FUND>` on the gateway, JSON, behind the same identity wall.

### `RIV-pd-3` -- the AI accounts are written on the same three periods (FWD-23; F.2 last bullet)
- Today `ai_accounts` builds its facts from `("R30",5),("MTD",3),("QTD",3),("YTD",3)` (:165) and the YTD trend rows (:176-183).
- Interface: the fact pack is built from `("R30",5),("R90",3),("R365",3)` and the R365 trend rows; fact keys read
  `<fund>|R90|<bucket>` / `<fund>|R365|<bucket>`; no fact label names MTD, QTD or YTD; the prompt text names the three periods
  in plain words (last 30 / 90 / 365 days). `ai_accounts.PACK_PERIODS = ("R30","R90","R365")` is the one constant.
  The "not shown as current" rule for an older account is render's (round 14's badge) and is not this cell's.
- Rulings at the cut (issuer): a "fact label" is the fact's id and its text. Periods are named to the model in words or digits
  ("last thirty days" / "last 30 days"), consistently with the SYSTEM prompt's own number rule. `P_DIRECTION`'s "the year's
  trend" becomes "the 365-day trend".
- **Organic trigger:** the 09:00 ET sweep's AI step.

## 2. WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW (measured at the cut, base CLOUD f14a8198f7)

- The check files' docstrings are the exact interface they read: read `org/missions/D5/ETFS/ETFS_RIVALS/deliverables/2.0.0_SA_COO~RV/round15/checks/pd-3.AC1.py` and `org/missions/D5/ETFS/ETFS_RIVALS/deliverables/2.0.0_SA_COO~RV/round15/checks/_common.py` before you build. Where a docstring and the cell's "Rulings at the cut" differ, the RULING wins and the check accepts it.
- NO OpenAI call: the check reads the pack builder and the messages `run_chain` hands a recording stub client.
- The grounding grader reads fact keys such as `TXUE|R30|<bucket>`: keep the key grammar `<fund>|<period>|<bucket>` and re-run the package's grounding tests.
- The tables gain R90 / R365 rows in another chain; build against fixture rows (the check's fixture shows their shape).

## 3. SURFACES AND BOUNDS

You READ (never edit): `lib/`, `integrations/bloomberg/` (Andrew-direct no-modify order), every file not in your `<paths>`, the round-8..15 check folders under `org/missions/D5/ETFS/ETFS_RIVALS/deliverables/2.0.0_SA_COO~RV/`, the decomposition, and `org/missions/D5/ETFS/ETFS_RIVALS/prd/ETFS_RIVALS_PRD.md` (FWD-22, FWD-23, ADDENDUM F).

You WRITE only the `<paths>` below (plus `deliverables/0.9.0_WK_ETFS_RIVALS~5/`). NEVER: any S3 read or write, any deploy or gateway release, any Terraform, any OpenAI or Bloomberg call (stub every vendor hook), any environment gate flip outside a test, any file under `integrations/`. New tests as `data/etfs/scripts/rivalfunds/tests/test_r15pd3_*.py`; run the whole package suite (`python -m pytest rivalfunds/tests -q` from `data/etfs/scripts/`) before you report: 0 failed. A check you cannot satisfy without leaving your `<paths>` is a surprise row in the investigation file (`surfaced_at` = `date -u +%FT%TZ` at filing), never an edit outside them.

</paths>

## 4. PROOF OF SPEC (each invocation LITERAL, run from your worktree root)

- **AC1** -- PACK_PERIODS, facts keyed R90 and R365 from their own rows, none keyed or named MTD / QTD / YTD, trend facts from the R365 rows, the prompt names the three periods; control: the R30 facts are in the pack (`org/missions/D5/ETFS/ETFS_RIVALS/deliverables/2.0.0_SA_COO~RV/round15/checks/pd-3.AC1.py`)

<proof_of_spec>
  <criterion id="AC1" cell_refs="RIV-pd-3"><invocation>python org/missions/D5/ETFS/ETFS_RIVALS/deliverables/2.0.0_SA_COO~RV/round15/checks/pd-3.AC1.py</invocation><expect>AC1 RESULT: PASS 0 failures</expect></criterion>
</proof_of_spec>

## 5. WHEN YOU ARE DONE

Write the instance at `org/missions/D5/ETFS/ETFS_RIVALS/deliverables/0.9.0_WK_ETFS_RIVALS~5/ETFS_RIVALS.TO-RIV-pd-3.the-ai-accounts-are-written-on-the-three-rolling-periods.proof_of_spec.json` with `to_id` `ETFS_RIVALS.TO-RIV-pd-3.the-ai-accounts-are-written-on-the-three-rolling-periods`. Report once: each mechanical criterion's verdict line with the output above it; each judgment criterion left UNVERIFIABLE-BY-INSTRUMENT for the CVO; files written; every existing test assertion changed and why; the suite's final line; rows filed (id + one line); anything the issuer must do at the merge. Leave the `<status>` flip to the issuer.

Checks dry-run at base by the issuer: pd-3.AC1 FAIL as expected (control PASS). Check files drafted by read-only helpers under the issuer's brief and re-run by the issuer.
