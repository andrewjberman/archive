comp-schedule: RUN at L5 (2026-09-30 ~06:40Z) -- 39 gates armed over five carriers; none names the rivalfunds prefixes, the five names or opal-gateway; the shared tree's .open_deploys/ holds no gateway/etfs/rival entry; the 50 linked worktrees were not read (RIV-d-2 reads them). The notifier moratorium binds: no alarm, SNS or monitor.
comp-iam: RUN at L5 -- the thread touches IAM at RIV-w-1 (gateway read policy) and RIV-d-1 (five Lambda roles); each cell's own IAM simulation criterion is the instrument; no grant is applied before RIV-d-2, under the never-widen pair.
comp-adversary: DECLARED-NOT-APPLICABLE -- thread round; the lens runs on the enrichment round that touches its surface.

**Project:** ETFS_RIVALS (D5/ETFS, fabric site-z) -- *rivalfunds*: six rival active ETFs' daily holdings, each fund's
reverse-engineered trade schedule, and a daily research page at `/rivalfunds`. **Round 1 builds ONE live journey for BASG**:
issuer site -> bronze -> silver -> `canonical_shape` -> `trade_schedule` -> the day's page -> `/rivalfunds`, fired from AWS.
Your cell is one hop of it. Work ONLY in the worktree your spawn line names; every path below is relative to that root.

## 0. BEGIN ONLY WHEN THESE HOLD

1. `RIV-c-1` is complete in THIS worktree (you built it as this slot's previous order); its `land_bronze`, sinks and markers are what you consume.

## 1. YOUR CELL (inlined verbatim from the decomposition)

### `RIV-s-1` -- bronze to typed silver, the BASG issuer shape (H3)

`data/etfs/scripts/rivalfunds/silver_issuer.py`, `handler_entry` for stage `build-silver`: read the issuer bronze objects
of a batch (the `fetch-holdings` marker's outputs) or, in `replay`, every bronze object under the issuer bronze prefix for a
date range; parse pipe-delimited utf-8-sig; type every source column (dates, decimals as float64, identifiers as strings
with leading zeros kept); keep EVERY source row and column (all Brown funds, cash and currency lines), plus lineage columns
(`bronze_uri`, `sha256`, `captured_at`, `parser_version`); dedupe ACROSS captures only: when two captures carry the same
report date, the latest capture's rows win whole and the other capture's are dropped (count recorded); rows within one
capture are never dropped; a replay of bronze already in silver adds nothing; write Parquet to
`address('issuer-site','etfs','silver','holdings','date=<report_date>', 'basg-<capture_id>.parquet')`; skip bronze whose
sidecar status is not OK (counted in `detail.skipped_not_ok`, never given a date); write the marker. Tests `tests/test_s1_*.py`. Consumes RIV-c-1's
bronze layout and sidecar.


## 2. THE RULINGS THAT REACH EVERY CELL (inlined verbatim from the decomposition)

- **Addresses and names are builder output only** (CLAUDE.md rule 30; PRD C-HOMES, C-NAMES). Code calls
  `lib/opal_naming.py address(source, scope, tier, table, partition, object=None)` and
  `name(system, scope, function, kind, qualifier=None)`; a literal `s3://opal-data-etfs/...` or resource name typed in
  product code is a defect. Measured at this cut, all resolve with 0 refusals:
  - `address('issuer-site','etfs','bronze','holdings','date=<D>')` -> `s3://opal-data-etfs/issuer-site/etfs/bronze/holdings/date=<D>`
  - `address('issuer-site','etfs','silver','holdings','date=<D>')` -> `s3://opal-data-etfs/issuer-site/etfs/silver/holdings/date=<D>`
  - `address('rivalfunds','etfs','gold','canonical_shape','date=<D>')`, `...'trade_schedule'...` -> `s3://opal-data-etfs/rivalfunds/etfs/gold/<table>/date=<D>`
  - `address('rivalfunds','etfs','platinum','page','date=<D>')` -> `s3://opal-data-etfs/rivalfunds/etfs/platinum/page/date=<D>`
  - `address('rivalfunds','etfs','state','<stage>','date=<D>')` -> `s3://opal-data-etfs/rivalfunds/etfs/state/<stage>/date=<D>`
  - names (all `grade()` CONFORMANT): `etfs-rivalfunds-daily` (schedule/rule), `etfs-rivalfunds-daily-lambda`,
    `etfs-rivalfunds-fetch-holdings-lambda`, `rivalfunds-build-silver-lambda` (new, `name('rivalfunds',None,'build-silver','lambda')`),
    `rivalfunds-build-canonical-shape-lambda`, `rivalfunds-publish-page-lambda`.
  - NOT conformant, never used: `name('etfs',None,'rivalfunds','role','lambda')` grades OUT-OF-PATTERN; a role name is
    taken from a `name()` call that grades CONFORMANT or the cell files a row.
- **Partition dates:** bronze `date=` is the ACQUISITION date (spec S2); silver and gold `date=` are the REPORT date; the
  page `date=` is the publish day. An undated payload stays in bronze with a status and never acquires a guessed report
  date (C-SHAPES).
- **The stage entry contract** (so the infra cell wraps what the stage cells export, without an edge on file contents):
  every stage module exposes `handler_entry(event: dict, context=None) -> dict`, event
  `{"date": "YYYY-MM-DD", "mode": "daily"|"backfill"|"replay", "batch_id": str, "sink": "s3"|"local:<dir>"}` (plus
  `start`/`end` for `backfill`, and optional `start`/`end` for `replay`, default everything under the input prefix), returning
  `{"status": "OK"|"PARTIAL"|"FAILED"|"SKIPPED", "batch_id", "outputs": [<uri>...], "marker": <uri>|null, "detail"}`.
  A `local:<dir>` sink mirrors `s3://<bucket>/<key>` as `<dir>/<bucket>/<key>` so every test runs without a served write.
- **Batch-complete markers** (C-TRIGGERS): a stage writes `address('rivalfunds','etfs','state','<stage>','date=<D>', '<batch_id>.json')`
  only when its batch is whole; the next stage is idempotent on `batch_id`. Stage names, in order: `fetch-holdings`,
  `build-silver`, `build-canonical-shape`, `build-trade-schedule`, `publish-page` (the two gold stages run in one
  Lambda, `rivalfunds-build-canonical-shape-lambda`, each writing its own marker). The marker API is RIV-c-1's
  `markers.write_marker(stage, date, batch_id, sink, payload=None) -> uri`, `markers.read_markers(stage, date, sink) -> list[dict]`,
  `markers.has_marker(stage, date, sink) -> bool`.
- **Universe in round 1: BASG only.** The BASG issuer file carries other Brown Advisory funds; silver keeps every row,
  gold filters `fund_ticker == 'BASG'`.
- **Real data, never a fixture, on the seam** (FWD-1 ACCEPT). The captured BASG archive on this box,
  `C:\Users\Opal Bloomberg\Desktop\ajb_workspace\.runtime\amgt-reconn-daily-census-20260929\basg\` (324 issuer `.txt`
  files 2025-06-13..2026-09-28, each with a `.json` probe sidecar; gitignored, device-local), is the real neighbour for
  the silver and gold cells. The live issuer URL is
  `https://brownadvisory.filepoint.live/assets/data/SEI_Brown_Tradedate_Holdings_<MMDDYYYY>.txt` (pipe-delimited,
  utf-8-sig; header `date|fund_id|fund_name|fund_cusip|fund_ticker|security_group|security_type|security_number|security_cusip|security_sedol|security_isin|security_ticker|security_description|quantity|market_value|notional_value|percent_of_market_value|percent_of_net_assets`).
- **No vendor call in round 1.** No Bloomberg (R-21 scripted legs are enrichment), no OpenAI (FWD-7 is enrichment). No
  alert, monitor or notifier (C-NO-NOTIFIER).
- **Classification in round 1:** `asset_class` from the source's `security_group`/`security_type` (Cash/Currency -> the
  vocabulary's cash values via `etf_positioning_gold.is_cash_sentinel`/`classify(is_cash, None)`; common stock ->
  Equity); equity `sub_asset_class` and every GICS level are NULL with status `UNRESOLVED` and source `none (GICS is
  Bloomberg enrichment)`. Row `ETFS_RIVALS-Z-S1` (the vocabulary's sector-valued sub-asset class vs C-SHAPES) binds the
  enrichment round, not this one.


## 3. SURFACES AND BOUNDS

You READ (never edit):
- `data/etfs/scripts/rivalfunds/`
- `lib/opal_naming.py`
- `lib/trading_calendar.py`
- `infra/logic/registry/`
- `org/missions/D5/ETFS/ETFS_RIVALS/deliverables/2.0.0_SA_COO~RV/round1/checks/`
- the captured BASG archive, `C:\Users\Opal Bloomberg\Desktop\ajb_workspace\.runtime\amgt-reconn-daily-census-20260929\basg\` (outside your worktree; read-only).

You WRITE only the `<paths>` below (plus your own `deliverables/0.9.0_WK_ETFS_RIVALS~1/`). NEVER: `etfs-netassets-daily` or its homes; the
bucket's existing tier-first keys (`bronze/`, `silver/`, `gold/`, `daily/`, `platinum/`); `opal-data-assets`; any Bloomberg or
OpenAI call; any alert, alarm, SNS or monitor; any file another cell of this round owns. Write unit tests beside the code (`data/etfs/scripts/rivalfunds/tests/`), run with `python -m pytest <file> -q` from the tree root.

## 4. PROOF OF SPEC (each invocation LITERAL, run from your worktree root)

- **AC1** -- five real days to silver: one partition per report date, every source row and column, typed, with lineage (`org/missions/D5/ETFS/ETFS_RIVALS/deliverables/2.0.0_SA_COO~RV/round1/checks/s-1.AC1.py`)
- **AC2** -- replay twice adds nothing; a non-OK bronze object is skipped and counted (`org/missions/D5/ETFS/ETFS_RIVALS/deliverables/2.0.0_SA_COO~RV/round1/checks/s-1.AC2.py`)

<proof_of_spec>
  <criterion id="AC1" cell_refs="RIV-s-1"><invocation>python org/missions/D5/ETFS/ETFS_RIVALS/deliverables/2.0.0_SA_COO~RV/round1/checks/s-1.AC1.py</invocation><expect>AC1 RESULT: PASS 0 failures</expect></criterion>
