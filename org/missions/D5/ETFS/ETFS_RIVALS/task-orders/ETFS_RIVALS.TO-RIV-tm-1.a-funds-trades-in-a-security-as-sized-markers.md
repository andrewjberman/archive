comp-schedule: DECLARED-NOT-APPLICABLE no schedule, cron or trigger is added or moved by this cell (the backfill is ad hoc by Andrew's word and is run by the issuer, never scheduled)
comp-iam: DECLARED-NOT-APPLICABLE no IAM grant, role or policy changes in this cell (the chart objects sit under the page prefix the publisher already writes and the gateway already reads)
comp-adversary: DECLARED-NOT-APPLICABLE the validator-context composer profiles RETURNED work for the L8/L9 packet; at the cut nothing is returned, and the issuer's evidence context is this order's check files

**Project:** ETFS_RIVALS (D5/ETFS, fabric site-z) -- *rivalfunds*: a daily research page on rival active ETFs (13 funds, two peer groups): rankings, buying trend, AI accounts per fund, a security dialog per holding, and a separate audit page; published to S3 by the package `data/etfs/scripts/rivalfunds/` (five AWS stage Lambdas) and served signed-in by the opal-gateway. **Round 15** (PRD v0.18 FWD-22, FWD-23): every period becomes 30 / 90 / 365 calendar days; the security dialog gains a price curve with the fund's buys and sells marked on it, fed by a per-fund chart object behind one gateway route and drawn by the page's one script; a Bloomberg close-price backfill is built (never run by a worker). Nothing here deploys, merges or calls a vendor (stub every OpenAI and Bloomberg hook). Work ONLY in the worktree your spawn line names; every path below is relative to that root.

## 1. YOUR CELL (inlined verbatim from the decomposition)

Shared vocabulary (binding on every cell):
- **Periods:** `R30`, `R90`, `R365` -- calendar days. `asof = prev_trading_day(page_day)` (the existing CALL 3 rule); a window's
  first day is `asof - N calendar days`, its last day `asof`. `MTD`, `QTD`, `YTD` keep computing and are never displayed.
- **Chart object:** one JSON per fund per page day at `homes.page(<day>, "charts/<FUND>.json")` (opal_naming output), shape
  `{"fund", "asof", "generated_at", "ranges": {"R30": <first day>, "R90": ..., "R365": ...}, "securities": {<security_key>:
  {"name", "source_words", "points": [[<YYYY-MM-DD>, <price>|null, <source code>], ...], "gaps": [{"start", "end", "reason"}],
  "markers": [{"side": "buy"|"sell", "start", "end", "span": bool, "usd", "bps", "r", "n_trades"}]}}}`. Source codes:
  `m` market close, `i` holding-implied. `points` ascend by date and cover `asof - 365d .. asof`.
- **Route:** `GET /rivalfunds/<YYYY-MM-DD>/chart/<FUND>` on the gateway, JSON, behind the same identity wall.

### `RIV-tm-1` -- a fund's trades in a security as sized markers (FWD-22; C-TRADE-MARKER)
- Measured: `trade_schedule` (G5) carries `action`, `window_start`, `window_end`, `window_trading_days`, `est_notional`; no
  share-of-fund column for the trade itself.
- Interface: new `rivalfunds/trade_markers.py`. `markers(g5_rows, fund_mv_by_date: {date: float}) -> [{"side", "start", "end",
  "span", "usd", "bps", "r", "n_trades"}]` per (fund, security): `side` = `buy` for entry / add, `sell` for trim / exit; `usd`
  = abs(`est_notional`); `bps` = `usd / fund_mv_by_date[window_end] * 10000` (the fund's total reported market value on the
  window end; absent -> `bps` None and `r` = R_MIN); `r` = the marker radius: `R_MIN` (3.0) at 20 bps or less, `R_MAX` (12.0) at
  500 bps or more, linear in bps between; `span` = `window_trading_days > 1`; trades of one side sharing one window are ONE
  marker with `n_trades` counted and `usd` / `bps` summed. A REFUSED window yields no marker. `words(marker) -> str` reads
  "Bought" / "Sold", the date or "between <start> and <end>", the dollar value, the basis points of the fund, and the count.
- Rulings at the cut (issuer): `g5_rows` is a list of row dicts (or a DataFrame, converted); `fund_mv_by_date` is keyed by
  `datetime.date`. The fund's total reported market value includes its cash lines (it is the report's total). A refused window
  has no G5 rows, so "no marker" is: empty rows in, `[]` out. `words()` prints dollars as `$26,000` and dates as ISO.
- **Organic trigger:** the publisher's chart object (RIV-co-1).

## 2. WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW (measured at the cut, base CLOUD f14a8198f7)

- The check files' docstrings are the exact interface they read: read `org/missions/D5/ETFS/ETFS_RIVALS/deliverables/2.0.0_SA_COO~RV/round15/checks/tm-1.AC1.py` and `org/missions/D5/ETFS/ETFS_RIVALS/deliverables/2.0.0_SA_COO~RV/round15/checks/_common.py` before you build. Where a docstring and the cell's "Rulings at the cut" differ, the RULING wins and the check accepts it.
- G5's columns are in `gold_trade_schedule.py` `SCHEMA`; a refused window has no G5 rows (`_pair_rows`).
- You run this AFTER RIV-ps-1 on the same branch; RIV-co-1 follows.

## 3. SURFACES AND BOUNDS

You READ (never edit): `lib/`, `integrations/bloomberg/` (Andrew-direct no-modify order), every file not in your `<paths>`, the round-8..15 check folders under `org/missions/D5/ETFS/ETFS_RIVALS/deliverables/2.0.0_SA_COO~RV/`, the decomposition, and `org/missions/D5/ETFS/ETFS_RIVALS/prd/ETFS_RIVALS_PRD.md` (FWD-22, FWD-23, ADDENDUM F).

You WRITE only the `<paths>` below (plus `deliverables/0.9.0_WK_ETFS_RIVALS~2/`). NEVER: any S3 read or write, any deploy or gateway release, any Terraform, any OpenAI or Bloomberg call (stub every vendor hook), any environment gate flip outside a test, any file under `integrations/`. New tests as `data/etfs/scripts/rivalfunds/tests/test_r15tm1_*.py`; run the whole package suite (`python -m pytest rivalfunds/tests -q` from `data/etfs/scripts/`) before you report: 0 failed. A check you cannot satisfy without leaving your `<paths>` is a surprise row in the investigation file (`surfaced_at` = `date -u +%FT%TZ` at filing), never an edit outside them.

<paths>
data/etfs/scripts/rivalfunds/trade_markers.py

</paths>

## 4. PROOF OF SPEC (each invocation LITERAL, run from your worktree root)

- **AC1** -- side, dollars, basis points of the fund, the 20 / 500 bps radius clamp, spans, merged same-window trades, the words; control: the fixture rows are G5's own columns (`org/missions/D5/ETFS/ETFS_RIVALS/deliverables/2.0.0_SA_COO~RV/round15/checks/tm-1.AC1.py`)

<proof_of_spec>
  <criterion id="AC1" cell_refs="RIV-tm-1"><invocation>python org/missions/D5/ETFS/ETFS_RIVALS/deliverables/2.0.0_SA_COO~RV/round15/checks/tm-1.AC1.py</invocation><expect>AC1 RESULT: PASS 0 failures</expect></criterion>
</proof_of_spec>

## 5. WHEN YOU ARE DONE

Write the instance at `org/missions/D5/ETFS/ETFS_RIVALS/deliverables/0.9.0_WK_ETFS_RIVALS~2/ETFS_RIVALS.TO-RIV-tm-1.a-funds-trades-in-a-security-as-sized-markers.proof_of_spec.json` with `to_id` `ETFS_RIVALS.TO-RIV-tm-1.a-funds-trades-in-a-security-as-sized-markers`. Report once: each mechanical criterion's verdict line with the output above it; each judgment criterion left UNVERIFIABLE-BY-INSTRUMENT for the CVO; files written; every existing test assertion changed and why; the suite's final line; rows filed (id + one line); anything the issuer must do at the merge. Leave the `<status>` flip to the issuer.
