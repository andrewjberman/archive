# ETFS_RIVALS -- DECOMPOSITION, ROUND 12 (ENRICHMENT, NARROWED): the audit trail comes off the page so the main page keeps every security dialog (row Z-S47; ADDENDUM 4 steps 1-2)

## Rectangle (ADDENDUM 4, steps 1-2)

| item | cell | chain | risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| step 1: the audit block off the served page; the audit trail still written as its own platinum object; no link yet | RIV-au-1 | ~1 | SERVED |
| step 2: every ticker mention links to its modal, every dialog on the page; the over-cap FAIL line | RIV-au-1 (same write set) | ~1 | SERVED |
| step 2 proof on the 10-06 data (headroom >= 20% under DIALOG_SOFT_CAP; mentions = buttons, 0 dead) | issuer's one real run at the drain | - | - |
| step 3: GET /rivalfunds/YYYY-MM-DD/audit (gateway release under a never-widen pair), then the page link | NEXT round, after step 2 is graded | - | WORLD |

Edges: none (one cell). Stated gap (ADDENDUM 4): between step 1 and step 3, FWD-5's trade log and FWD-18's holdings list are
written but not served.

## Cells

### `RIV-au-1` -- the audit trail comes off the main page into its own dated object; every security mention links in-document; the over-cap fallback is loud (row Z-S47)
- Measured 2026-10-06 (2.0.0_SA_COO~RV): the served 2026-10-05 and 2026-10-06 pages (1,798,995 B and 1,813,001 B) carry
  `data-holding-dialogs="off"`, 0 `data-sec-dialog`, 0 `data-sec`. `render.render_page` (render.py:1796-1803) re-renders the
  whole page without holding dialogs once the with-dialogs render crosses `DIALOG_SOFT_CAP` (1,950,000 B, set under the
  gateway's 2 MB refusal). The closed `<details id="audit">` block is 1,119,671 B of the 10-06 page (holdings 454,238 B across
  13 funds, trade log 370,517 B across 221 trade panels).
- Interface:
  - `render.render_page(ctx)` returns the MAIN page with no audit block and NO link to the audit trail (the link lands with the
    gateway route in a later round, never a 404);
  - `render.render_audit_page(ctx)` returns the AUDIT page: a whole self-contained document (same shell and theme, no script)
    carrying the trades, holdings, refused and status sections and its OWN `_sec_dialogs` for the securities it names; every
    `data-sec` button on either page resolves to a `data-sec-dialog` element in the SAME document;
  - `render.validate` grades the main page (components lead, self-contained, no audit block) and a validator for the audit page
    grades what the closed block graded before (trades and holdings once each, one trace per trade);
  - `publish_page` writes `homes.page(day, "audit.html")` with read-back beside `index.html`, keeps a changed prior audit.html
    under `revisions/<ts>/` as it does index.html, and the manifest carries `audit_uri`, `audit_sha256`, `audit_bytes`,
    `holding_dialogs` ("on" | "off");
  - over `DIALOG_SOFT_CAP` the day still publishes, but the manifest and the run result's `detail` read
    `holding_dialogs: "off"` and the stage prints `FAIL: holding dialogs off ...` to stdout.
- **Organic trigger:** the 07:00 ET marker publish (publish-page stage).
