# ETFS_RIVALS -- DECOMPOSITION, ROUND 12 (ENRICHMENT): the audit trail comes off the page so the main page keeps every security dialog (Z-S47; ADDENDUM 4 steps 1-2); then, on the Bloomberg hold lifting, the enrichment session bound (ADDENDUM 2) and Bloomberg's own key for CUSIP/ISIN rows (ADDENDUM 1)

## Rectangle (ADDENDUM 4, steps 1-2)

| item | cell | chain | risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| step 1: the audit block off the served page; the audit trail still written as its own platinum object; no link yet | RIV-au-1 | ~1 | SERVED |
| step 2: every ticker mention links to its modal, every dialog on the page; the over-cap FAIL line | RIV-au-1 (same write set) | ~1 | SERVED |
| step 2 proof on the 10-06 data (headroom >= 20% under DIALOG_SOFT_CAP; mentions = buttons, 0 dead) | issuer's one real run at the drain | - | - |
| step 3: GET /rivalfunds/YYYY-MM-DD/audit (gateway release under a never-widen pair), then the page link | NEXT round, after step 2 is graded | - | WORLD |
| ADDENDUM 2: the enrichment bounds its Bloomberg session attempts; unreachable exits 1 | RIV-eb-1 | ~2 (1 of 2) | SERVED |
| ADDENDUM 1: PARSEKYABLE_DES on the existing G4 reference request; the one-key join reads it | RIV-pk-1 | ~2 (2 of 2) | SERVED |
| ADDENDUM 5: the three readers take pk-1's parsekey (BBGLEG round 13) | RIV-al-1 | ~3 | SERVED |

Edges: none of data. eb-1 and pk-1 both write `enrichment_bloomberg.py`, so they are ONE chain (`~2`, one worker queue: eb-1 then pk-1); au-1 (`~1`) is disjoint. Stated gap (ADDENDUM 4): between step 1 and step 3, FWD-5's trade log and FWD-18's holdings list are
written but not served.

## Cells

### `RIV-au-1` -- the audit trail comes off the main page into its own dated object; every security mention links in-document; the over-cap fallback is loud (row Z-S47)
- Measured 2026-10-06 (2.0.0_SA_COO~RV): the served 2026-10-05 and 2026-10-06 pages (1,798,995 B and 1,813,001 B) carry
  `data-holding-dialogs="off"`, 0 `data-sec-dialog`, 0 `data-sec`. `render.render_page` (render.py:1796-1803) re-renders the
  whole page without holding dialogs once the with-dialogs render crosses `DIALOG_SOFT_CAP` (1,950,000 B, set under the
  gateway's 2 MB refusal). The closed `<details id="audit">` block is 1,119,671 B of the 10-06 page (holdings 454,238 B across
  13 funds, trade log 370,517 B across 221 trade panels).
- Interface:
  - `render.render_page(ctx)` returns the MAIN page with no audit block and NO link to the audit trail (the link lands with the
    gateway route in a later round, never a 404);
  - `render.render_audit_page(ctx)` returns the AUDIT page: a whole self-contained document (same shell and theme, no script)
    carrying the trades, holdings, refused and status sections and its OWN `_sec_dialogs` for the securities it names; every
    `data-sec` button on either page resolves to a `data-sec-dialog` element in the SAME document;
  - `render.validate` grades the main page (components lead, self-contained, no audit block) and a validator for the audit page
    grades what the closed block graded before (trades and holdings once each, one trace per trade);
  - `publish_page` writes `homes.page(day, "audit.html")` with read-back beside `index.html`, keeps a changed prior audit.html
    under `revisions/<ts>/` as it does index.html, and the manifest carries `audit_uri`, `audit_sha256`, `audit_bytes`,
    `holding_dialogs` ("on" | "off");
  - over `DIALOG_SOFT_CAP` the day still publishes, but the manifest and the run result's `detail` read
    `holding_dialogs: "off"` and the stage prints `FAIL: holding dialogs off ...` to stdout.
- **Organic trigger:** the 07:00 ET marker publish (publish-page stage).

### `RIV-eb-1` -- the enrichment bounds its Bloomberg session attempts and exits "unreachable" (ADDENDUM 2 @b555e81836)
- Measured 2026-10-06: with the DAPI precondition already FAILED, `rivalfunds.enrichment_bloomberg` kept issuing one blp_client
  request per batch (each opens its own short-lived session; `no RESPONSE ... within 90s` per batch) until Task Scheduler's
  30-minute ExecutionTimeLimit killed the vehicle at 11:30:01Z (0x41306); the names stage and the D12 leg never ran. Offline at
  base: 300 securities, Bloomberg down -> 18 calls (6 dividend + 6 historical + 6 reference batches), exit 3.
- Interface: an exception whose class name is `BloombergError` (blp_client's session/connect-level error: session start, open
  service, no-RESPONSE timeout) is UNREACHABLE; `BlpResponseError` and per-security errors are not. `SESSION_ATTEMPTS` (module
  int, 2 or 3): after that many CONSECUTIVE unreachable failures in one run the run makes no further Bloomberg call (dividends,
  market, names), lands nothing, and returns status FAILED with `detail.unreachable` true and `detail.session_attempts`;
  `exit_code` maps it to 1 (the existing contract). eg-1's guard unchanged. `integrations/bloomberg/` is NOT touched (Andrew's
  no-modify order).
- **Organic trigger:** the vehicle's 07:00 ET enrichment step on a day Bloomberg is unreachable.

### `RIV-pk-1` -- Bloomberg's own key for CUSIP/ISIN-keyed securities rides the existing G4 request; the one-key join reads it (ADDENDUM 1 @982e914b1d, row Z-S43)
- Measured 2026-10-06 on G1 2026-10-01: GQGU reports Nebius CUSIP-only (security_id null, raw N97284108, cusip N97284108, isin
  NL0009805522); WCMG reports `NBIS_US_Equity` with NO CUSIP/ISIN. RIV-ok-1's CUSIP/ISIN join cannot meet them; a refresh publish
  at its code is byte-identical to the control (Nebius shows twice).
- Interface: `enrichment_bloomberg` mode `market`: the current-value reference request for an identifier-keyed security
  ('/cusip/..', '/isin/..') also asks `PARSEKYABLE_DES`; a Bloomberg-keyed security's request does not. The answer lands in G4
  column `security_parsekey` (null when not asked or not answered); the market result's detail carries the number of
  PARSEKYABLE_DES points asked (S24's daily budget). `gold_holding_contribution` and the trade schedule's position key (RIV-ok-1's
  `row_keys` / `stable_key`): a row keyed by a CUSIP/ISIN whose G4 row carries `security_parsekey` P takes the key
  `security_key(P)` when another row in the input window carries that key; otherwise it keeps its own key.
- **Organic trigger:** the vehicle's 07:00 ET market pull (G4), then the 07:00 ET marker publish (A1) and the batch chain (G5).

### `RIV-al-1` -- the three readers take pk-1's parsekey, so one security under two listings is one key on the whole page (ADDENDUM 5 @a8fb9c1df1)
- Measured 2026-10-06 (2.0.0_SA_COO~RV, AST census of `data/etfs/scripts/rivalfunds/` at CLOUD 325e20b091): 20 call sites of 10
  functions that take pk-1's parsekey (`pk` / `parsekeys`); 6 omit it -- gold_buying_trend.py:79 and :192 (identity_maps),
  gold_input_census.py:139 (identity_maps), :140 (_cross_sectors), :146 (_books), sweep.py:306 (held_funds). On a two-listing
  plant (GQGU Nebius CUSIP-only N97284108 + WCMG NBIS_US_Equity, G4 parsekey N97284108 -> "NBIS US Equity") the rankings bucket
  both under NBIS_US_Equity while the trend and the census name GQGU's by N97284108.
- Interface: each of the six sites passes the parsekey, taken from the G4 the reader already reads (`parsekey_map(g4)`) or, for
  the sweep's hold gate, from `gold_trade_schedule.load_parsekeys(s, canonical)`; `gold_buying_trend.build(..., g4)` derives it
  from its `g4` argument. A reader with no G4 passes an empty map (today's behaviour). No other site changes.
- **Organic trigger:** the 07:00 ET marker publish (A1: trend, census) and the 09:00 ET sweep (the hold gate).

## ROUND 13 (main workstream) -- APPENDED, the cells above stay for the orders that cite them

Source: `org/missions/D5/ETFS/ETFS_RIVALS/ledger/ROUND_ANALYSIS.round11.md` @3ae96d6bc7 section 3 (items 1, 2; item 3 is BBGLEG round
13 RIV-al-1, drained 2d78ef2151; item 4 is a surprise row against the gate). Author 2.0.0_SA_COO~RV; frozen; revision 1.3 of this
file. Edges: none of data. fe-1 and lk-1 both write `render.py`: ONE chain (`~2`: fe-1 then lk-1). gw-1 (`~1`) is disjoint.
Deploy order (record): gw-1's gateway release under its pair BEFORE the publisher Lambda carrying lk-1's link.

| item | cell | chain | risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1a the audit gateway route | RIV-gw-1 | ~1 | SERVED (build) / WORLD (release, issuer act) |
| 2 fund-engagement: C-S47 + Z-S50 + per-button section census + C-S36 names | RIV-fe-1 | ~2 (1 of 2) | SERVED |
| 1b the page link + citation lines to the audit page | RIV-lk-1 | ~2 (2 of 2) | SERVED |

### `RIV-gw-1` -- the gateway serves the day's audit page at GET /rivalfunds/YYYY-MM-DD/audit (ADDENDUM 4 step 3; round-11 analysis item 1)
- Measured 2026-10-06: `infra/aws/ec2/opal-gateway/app/rivalfunds_view.py` serves only `<key_prefix>date=<day>/index.html`
  (`object_key`, `_PAGE_NAME`); server.py mounts `/rivalfunds`, `/rivalfunds/`, `/rivalfunds/archive`, `/rivalfunds/{day}`. The
  publisher has written `audit.html` beside index.html every day since round 12 (10-06: 1,326,857 B). The read policy
  (`gen_rivalfunds_location.py` `policy_doc`) already grants GetObject on `<key_prefix>*`: no new grant.
- Interface: `audit_key(day)` = `<key_prefix>date=<day>/audit.html` from the generated location (never typed) and the handler
  `rivalfunds_audit(request)`: no viewer 401; a bad date 400; a missing object 404 naming the day's audit page with a link to the
  day's page; otherwise the bytes with `_HEADERS`, under the same 2 MB cap and TTL cache as the page. The server.py Route line is
  the issuer's hookup at the merge; the gateway release is the issuer's act under a never-widen pair, BEFORE lk-1's link deploys.
- **Organic trigger:** a signed-in viewer following the main page's audit link.

### `RIV-fe-1` -- every mention in fund F's panel opens a modal with F's engagement; the page counts it; the trend's ticker-named keys get names (round-11 analysis rulings 1, 2, 5: C-S47 + Z-S50 + C-S36)
- Measured on the served 10-06 page (CVO census, C-S47): 15 mentions (3 securities, 2 funds) open a modal with no section for the
  linking fund -- Nebius (two keys; pk-1 + al-1), Alphabet (a share-class name crossing to the other listing), SpaceX (a fresh
  GQGU entry with no contribution row and no YTD trend row, so `_sec_dialogs` writes no GQGU section). Four securities still read
  in ticker form (C-S36): 8053 JP, RBLX US (rankings / AI text), 9433 JP, 000270 KS (trend only) -- the names stage reads only
  holding_contribution keys.
- Interface: a name mention inside fund F's panel links to the key F holds or traded among the keys carrying that name (a name two
  listings share resolves by F's own holdings, Z-S50; when F holds none, the page-wide rule applies). `_sec_dialogs` writes a
  `section data-fund=<_fid(F)>` for EVERY fund F with a contribution row OR a trend row (any period) for that key -- a trend-only
  fund's section states its buying. `render.fund_section_census(html) -> {"buttons", "with_section", "missing"}` over every
  `data-sec` button inside a `data-fund-panel`; `publish_page` puts it in the manifest (`fund_sections`) and prints a line starting
  `FAIL: fund sections missing` when missing > 0. `security_names` asks for the ticker-named keys of the newest holding_contribution
  AND buying_trend objects.
- **Organic trigger:** the 07:00 ET marker publish; the names stage on the vehicle's daily run.

### `RIV-lk-1` -- the main page's one audit link; the AI citation lines move to the audit page (ADDENDUM 4 step 3; round-11 analysis ruling 3)
- Measured on the served 10-06 page (CVO): the AI modals carry 148 machine keys in 89 citation lines ("Cited rows: ..."), plain;
  the main page has no audit link (au-1, by design until the route serves).
- Interface: `render.render_page(ctx)` carries exactly one `<a href="/rivalfunds/<day>/audit">` worded as "one step away"; no AI modal
  on the main page carries a "Cited rows:" line (grade line, full text, Observed/Inferred, invalidation stay). `render_audit_page`
  carries a section `id="citations"` with, per fund and account, its "Cited rows:" line (and [web] reads when present), each block
  `data-cited-fund="<fund>"` `data-ai-kind="<kind>"`. Deploys only after RIV-gw-1's route serves (never a 404).
- **Organic trigger:** the 07:00 ET marker publish after the route serves.

## ROUND 14 (main workstream) -- APPENDED

Source: `org/missions/D5/ETFS/ETFS_RIVALS/ledger/ROUND_ANALYSIS.round13.md` @594d1be8f8 (section 4 item 1 = ruling 4; ADDENDUM 1 =
Z-S54) and Andrew-direct `cooRV_ANDREW_DIRECT_20261007_031xZ_RIVALFUNDS_AI_VARIANCE_DO_A_AND_C_NOT_B.md` @3e040ecbf2. Author
2.0.0_SA_COO~RV; frozen; revision 1.4 of this file. Section 4 item 2 ("whatever the morning pass returns") is NOT in this
issuance: the pass runs after the 2026-10-07 07:00 ET vehicle run and its rows go to the next round; Andrew's word on Z-S54 is
cut now. Edges: none of data. ab-1 and as-1 both write `render.py` and `publish_page.py`: ONE chain (`~1`: ab-1 then as-1).

| item | cell | chain | risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| Z-S54 (A) the sweep order + (C) the badge and its manifest count | RIV-ab-1 | ~1 (1 of 2) | SERVED |
| ruling 4: the audit page's own size rule | RIV-as-1 | ~1 (2 of 2) | SERVED |

### `RIV-ab-1` -- an AI account is written against the build the page serves, and its badge says so when it is not (row Z-S54; round-13 analysis ADDENDUM 1; Andrew: "not needed do a and c")
- Measured on the served 2026-10-06 page (2.0.0_SA_COO~RV): 22 of 26 accounts carry a figure that differs from the panel beside it;
  149 of 197 cited contribution figures moved (IDVZ direction verdict: "Petrobras ... +0.47%" against the rankings' +0.93%), each
  under a green "Grounded". The AI step ran at 13:00:20Z against the 11:03Z tables; `sweep.run_ai_step` (sweep.py ~589) runs
  `ai_stage.run_for_day` FIRST and only the republish after it (publish_page.produce_a1's stale rebuild) rebuilt
  holding_contribution and buying_trend, at 13:05-13:06Z. The only disclosure is a small "Written against earlier tables" line.
- Interface:
  - (A) `sweep.run_ai_step` calls `publish_page.produce_a1(<sink object>, <sink spec>, <date>)` BEFORE `ai_stage.run_for_day` and
    returns its result under `a1_refresh`; a refresh that raises is recorded and the AI step still runs; nothing is refreshed
    when the AI step does not apply. Each account already records the revision of every row it cites (`cited_rows[].revision`).
  - (C) the PASS badge is `<span class="rf-grounding-PASS" data-grade="PASS" data-build="served">Grounded</span>` when every
    revision the account's cited rows carry for a vintage table (holding_contribution, buying_trend) is a revision the page
    serves for that table, else `... data-build="earlier">Grounded on an earlier build</span>` -- the same element, place and
    weight. `render.grounding_census(html) -> {"served": n, "earlier": m}`; `publish_page` writes it into the manifest as
    `ai_grounding`. A FAIL badge is unchanged. NO account is re-run after a rebuild (Andrew: B is not needed).
- **Organic trigger:** the 09:00 ET sweep's AI step and its republish.

### `RIV-as-1` -- the audit page's own loud size rule (row Z-W1-S48; round-13 analysis ruling 4)
- Measured 2026-10-07: the served audit.html is 1,381,244 B against the gateway's 2,097,152 B read cap (34.1% under); the trade
  log grows every day; `publish_page` checks only index.html against MAX_PAGE_BYTES and writes audit.html unconditionally.
- Interface: `render.AUDIT_SOFT_CAP` (bytes, default 1_950_000). `render.render_audit_page(ctx)` returns a document of at most
  that size when a cut can achieve it: trade trace panels are dropped OLDEST first (by window end) until it fits, and the page
  then carries one element `data-audit-cut="<count left out>"` stating in plain words how many trades were left out and the
  oldest window end still shown; with nothing cut the attribute is absent. `publish_page`: the manifest carries
  `audit_trades_left_out` (0 when none) and, when it is > 0, the stage prints a line starting `FAIL: audit page over cap` (the
  day still publishes). The gateway never refuses the audit page silently.
- **Organic trigger:** the 07:00 ET marker publish.

## ROUND 15 (main workstream) -- APPENDED

Source: PRD v0.18 `FWD-22`, `FWD-23`, ADDENDUM F (F.1-F.7) @6e245cbebe; five Andrew-direct records of 2026-10-07 04:5xZ-05:2xZ
(modal @ad78eef973, periods @82bb78106e, backfill/page-only/MTD @96d0ab2f4b, calendar days @69c7f24b44, script @efc0acb127);
scoping facts `deliverables/2.0.0_SA_COO~RV/round15_prep/MODAL_PRICE_SERIES_AND_PERIODS_SCOPING_FACTS.md` @d773ddba61. Author
2.0.0_SA_COO~RV; frozen; revision 1.5 of this file. Every interface below is PRESCRIBED so that a consuming cell builds against
the interface with a fixture and never against a sibling's branch: the edges are of interface, not of files.

Shared vocabulary (binding on every cell):
- **Periods:** `R30`, `R90`, `R365` -- calendar days. `asof = prev_trading_day(page_day)` (the existing CALL 3 rule); a window's
  first day is `asof - N calendar days`, its last day `asof`. `MTD`, `QTD`, `YTD` keep computing and are never displayed.
- **Chart object:** one JSON per fund per page day at `homes.page(<day>, "charts/<FUND>.json")` (opal_naming output), shape
  `{"fund", "asof", "generated_at", "ranges": {"R30": <first day>, "R90": ..., "R365": ...}, "securities": {<security_key>:
  {"name", "source_words", "points": [[<YYYY-MM-DD>, <price>|null, <source code>], ...], "gaps": [{"start", "end", "reason"}],
  "markers": [{"side": "buy"|"sell", "start", "end", "span": bool, "usd", "bps", "r", "n_trades"}]}}}`. Source codes:
  `m` market close, `i` holding-implied. `points` ascend by date and cover `asof - 365d .. asof`.
- **Route:** `GET /rivalfunds/<YYYY-MM-DD>/chart/<FUND>` on the gateway, JSON, behind the same identity wall.

Chains (M = 5; file sets disjoint across chains):

| chain | cells in order | files | risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| ~1 | RIV-pd-1, RIV-pd-2, RIV-md-1 | gold_holding_contribution.py, gold_buying_trend.py; then render.py | SERVED |
| ~2 | RIV-ps-1, RIV-tm-1, RIV-co-1 | price_series.py (new), trade_markers.py (new); then publish_page.py | SERVED |

| ~4 | RIV-rt-1 | infra/aws/ec2/opal-gateway/app/rivalfunds_view.py, server.py, their tests | WORLD |
| ~5 | RIV-pd-3 | ai_accounts.py | SERVED |

### `RIV-pd-1` -- the gold tables compute 30d / 90d / 365d as calendar days (FWD-23; F.2, F.6)
- Today `gold_holding_contribution.PERIODS = ("MTD","QTD","YTD","R30")` with R30 = the 30th NYSE trading day ending on the day
  (`period_start`, :120-128); `gold_buying_trend.PERIODS = ("YTD","R30","MTD","QTD")`, R30 likewise (`_period_starts`, :123-136).
- Interface: both modules' `PERIODS` gain `R90` and `R365` and keep `MTD`, `QTD`, `YTD`. `gold_holding_contribution.period_start(p,
  day)` and `gold_buying_trend._period_starts(day)[p]` return, for `R30` / `R90` / `R365`, `date(day) - 30 / 90 / 365` calendar
  days (`day` here is the as-of the stage already passes). `earliest_start` follows. A fund whose history starts after the window's
  first day keeps the existing partial rule (`period_clipped`, `price_coverage`). Each table's stage detail states, for one fund,
  the old and the new R30 window (`r30_window_was`, `r30_window_is`).
- Rulings at the cut (issuer): ONE anchor for both tables. The pure functions stay pure on the day they are handed
  (`period_start(p, d)` and `_period_starts(d)[p]` return `d - N` calendar days); `gold_buying_trend.build` hands the three
  rolling periods `gold_holding_contribution.as_of(<event day>)`, exactly as holding_contribution already does, so both tables'
  R30 / R90 / R365 start on the same day. MTD / QTD / YTD keep their present anchors and starts. `r30_window_was` and
  `r30_window_is` sit in each stage's result `detail`, each `{"fund": <id>, "start": <ISO>, "end": <ISO>}` for the first fund
  built.
- **Organic trigger:** the 07:00 ET marker publish's stale-table rebuild (`publish_page.produce_a1`).

### `RIV-pd-2` -- every switch on the page offers 30d | 90d 365d and opens on 30d; no QTD, YTD or MTD is displayed (FWD-23)
- Today `render.PERIODS = ("R30","QTD","YTD")`, `PERIOD_LABEL` names them, `_dialog_keys` covers R30 and YTD (:753), the trend
  sentence says "this year" for YTD (:1750), `_sec_dialogs` prefers the YTD trend row (:1776).
- Interface: `render.PERIODS = ("R30","R90","R365")`; `PERIOD_LABEL = {"R30": "Last 30 days", "R90": "Last 90 days", "R365":
  "Last 365 days"}`; the switch reads 30d, the dividing line, then 90d and 365d, and opens on R30. No element of the rendered
  main page or audit page carries the visible text QTD, YTD, MTD, "Quarter to date", "Year to date" or "Month to date". The
  dialog keys cover R30 and R365; the security dialog's trend row prefers R365. A period that ranks nothing for the fund greys
  and says why (unchanged rule). Rows of MTD / QTD / YTD in the context are ignored, not an error.
- Rulings at the cut (issuer): the switch's own words are short -- `render.PERIOD_SHORT = {"R30": "30d", "R90": "90d", "R365":
  "365d"}` is what each period radio's label prints (Andrew: "30d, then | 90d and 365d"); `PERIOD_LABEL` (the long names) is
  for table headings and dialog rows. The clause "the dialog keys cover R30 and R365" is WITHDRAWN (`_dialog_keys` has no
  caller); the dialog lists the three periods and its buying line is the R365 trend row.
- **Organic trigger:** the 07:00 ET marker publish.

### `RIV-pd-3` -- the AI accounts are written on the same three periods (FWD-23; F.2 last bullet)
- Today `ai_accounts` builds its facts from `("R30",5),("MTD",3),("QTD",3),("YTD",3)` (:165) and the YTD trend rows (:176-183).
- Interface: the fact pack is built from `("R30",5),("R90",3),("R365",3)` and the R365 trend rows; fact keys read
  `<fund>|R90|<bucket>` / `<fund>|R365|<bucket>`; no fact label names MTD, QTD or YTD; the prompt text names the three periods
  in plain words (last 30 / 90 / 365 days). `ai_accounts.PACK_PERIODS = ("R30","R90","R365")` is the one constant.
  The "not shown as current" rule for an older account is render's (round 14's badge) and is not this cell's.
- Rulings at the cut (issuer): a "fact label" is the fact's id and its text. Periods are named to the model in words or digits
  ("last thirty days" / "last 30 days"), consistently with the SYSTEM prompt's own number rule. `P_DIRECTION`'s "the year's
  trend" becomes "the 365-day trend".
- **Organic trigger:** the 09:00 ET sweep's AI step.

### `RIV-ps-1` -- one price series per security: market close first, holding-implied second, a gap with its reason third (FWD-22; C-MODAL-PRICE-SOURCE)
- Measured: `gold/security_market` holds 4 day partitions; `trade_schedule` 504. No module assembles a per-security daily series.
- Interface: new `rivalfunds/price_series.py`. `series(g4: DataFrame, g1: DataFrame, keys, start: date, end: date) -> {key:
  {"points": [(date, price|None, "m"|"i"|None)], "gaps": [{"start","end","reason"}], "source_words": str}}`. For each NYSE
  trading day in `[start, end]`: the G4 `px_close` of that date when present and positive (`m`); else the price implied by any
  universe fund's G1 report of that date, `market_value / quantity` with quantity > 0 (`i`; when several funds report, the
  median); else `None`. Consecutive `None` days form one gap with reason `"no market close on file and no fund reported the
  holding"`. `source_words` names in plain words which sources the series uses. No vendor call, no S3 call: pure over frames.
  `load(s, keys, start, end)` reads the two tables through the sink for the publisher.
- Rulings at the cut (issuer): a G1 row maps to a key through `gold_holding_contribution.row_keys` (the page's own key rule,
  raw-identifier alias included), never `security_id` alone. Several lots of one security in one fund's report are summed
  (market value and quantity) before the ratio. A key in neither frame returns all-None points and one gap over the range.
  Point dates are ISO strings. `load(s, keys, start, end)` returns the same dict `series` returns.
- **Organic trigger:** the publisher's chart object (RIV-co-1).

### `RIV-tm-1` -- a fund's trades in a security as sized markers (FWD-22; C-TRADE-MARKER)
- Measured: `trade_schedule` (G5) carries `action`, `window_start`, `window_end`, `window_trading_days`, `est_notional`; no
  share-of-fund column for the trade itself.
- Interface: new `rivalfunds/trade_markers.py`. `markers(g5_rows, fund_mv_by_date: {date: float}) -> [{"side", "start", "end",
  "span", "usd", "bps", "r", "n_trades"}]` per (fund, security): `side` = `buy` for entry / add, `sell` for trim / exit; `usd`
  = abs(`est_notional`); `bps` = `usd / fund_mv_by_date[window_end] * 10000` (the fund's total reported market value on the
  window end; absent -> `bps` None and `r` = R_MIN); `r` = the marker radius: `R_MIN` (3.0) at 20 bps or less, `R_MAX` (12.0) at
  500 bps or more, linear in bps between; `span` = `window_trading_days > 1`; trades of one side sharing one window are ONE
  marker with `n_trades` counted and `usd` / `bps` summed. A REFUSED window yields no marker. `words(marker) -> str` reads
  "Bought" / "Sold", the date or "between <start> and <end>", the dollar value, the basis points of the fund, and the count.
- Rulings at the cut (issuer): `g5_rows` is a list of row dicts (or a DataFrame, converted); `fund_mv_by_date` is keyed by
  `datetime.date`. The fund's total reported market value includes its cash lines (it is the report's total). A refused window
  has no G5 rows, so "no marker" is: empty rows in, `[]` out. `words()` prints dollars as `$26,000` and dates as ISO.
- **Organic trigger:** the publisher's chart object (RIV-co-1).

### `RIV-co-1` -- the publisher writes one chart object per fund beside the page, with its size line (FWD-22; F.5 items 1 and 4)
- Interface: `publish_page` writes `homes.page(day, "charts/<FUND>.json")` for every fund of the page, in the shape of the shared
  vocabulary, covering exactly the securities whose dialog on the rendered page carries that fund's section
  (`publish_page.dialog_fund_keys(html) -> {fund: [security_key, ...]}`, exported by THIS cell from a regex over the rendered HTML:
  `data-sec-dialog="<key>"` blocks and their `<section data-fund=...>` children; no render.py edit). Built from
  `price_series.load` and `trade_markers.markers`. `CHART_MAX_BYTES = 1_900_000` per object: over it, the 365-day points are
  thinned to weekly (and the object says `"thinned": true`); still over -> the object is not written and the stage prints `FAIL:
  chart object over cap for <FUND>`. The manifest gains `charts: {<FUND>: {"uri", "bytes", "securities", "markers",
  "thinned"}}`. The day's page publishes whether or not a chart object fails. Write once per revision, like audit.html.
- Rulings at the cut (issuer): `dialog_fund_keys(html)` and `CHART_MAX_BYTES` live in `publish_page` (this cell's file) and the
  cap is read at call time. A fund of the page with no dialog section gets NO object and no manifest entry. In the manifest
  `securities` and `markers` are counts. Thinning keeps the last trading day of each ISO week and every day that carries a
  marker's start or end. A fund whose object is refused has the manifest entry `{"uri": null, "bytes": <over-cap bytes>,
  "refused": true}`. `fund_mv_by_date` is the sum of `market_value` over the fund's G1 report of that date.
- **Organic trigger:** the 07:00 ET marker publish.

### `RIV-bf-1` -- an ad hoc Bloomberg close-price backfill over a date range, on the existing market route, under a row budget (FWD-22; F.5 card 2 answer; WORLD)
- Andrew-direct @96d0ab2f4b: "Yes for the rivalfunds funds only ... an ad hoc backfill for the selected funds that uses the
  existing BBG route"; @69c7f24b44: about 365 calendar days. Existing route: `enrichment_bloomberg` mode `market` already sends a
  one-day `HistoricalDataRequest` for a past date (`_market_pull`, `_blp_historical_data`).
- Interface: new mode `market-range` of stage `pull-enrichment`: event `{"mode": "market-range", "start", "end", "securities":
  [...], "batch_id", "sink", "max_points": int, "dry_run": bool}`. It plans `len(securities) x trading days in [start, end]`
  points; `dry_run` returns the plan and spends nothing; if the plan exceeds `max_points`, or exceeds `bbg_budget`'s
  `ceiling - reserve - spent(today)`, it REFUSES before any request, naming the points left. Otherwise ONE historical request
  per batch of 50 securities over `[start, end]` for `px_close`'s field only; it writes one `gold/security_market/date=<D>`
  object per date that has rows (never overwriting an existing object of that date: a date already holding a `market-*.parquet`
  is skipped and counted), each row `as_of_source = "backfill"`; it records the points in the `bbg_budget` ledger with mode
  `market-range`; a tripped session stops the run with what landed stated. No file under `integrations/` changes. The live
  run is the ISSUER's act under a never-widen pair, after the day's 07:00 ET vehicle run; the worker makes NO Bloomberg call.
- Rulings at the cut (issuer): a refusal is `status == "REFUSED"` (the module's own word). The result carries `plan: {"points",
  "securities", "trading_days", "batches"}`; a refusal's detail names the planned points and the points left, where "left" is
  the smaller of `max_points` and the budget remainder. Skipped dates are returned as `skipped_dates` (a list). The ledger
  records the points REQUESTED (securities x trading days of the range), since that is what the vendor was asked for. The
  budget read is a new `bbg_budget.check_points(points, today=None) -> None | detail` beside `check_backfill` (unchanged).
  A tripped session returns `FAILED` naming the dates that landed.
- **Organic trigger:** none (ad hoc by Andrew's word); the negative arm is the daily `market` mode, unchanged.

### `RIV-rt-1` -- the gateway serves a fund's chart object (FWD-22; F.5 item 2; WORLD, released by NFRA_OPLGTW)
- Today `rivalfunds_view` serves `/rivalfunds/<day>` and `/rivalfunds/<day>/audit` (2 MB cap, audit log, identity wall).
- Interface: `rivalfunds_view.chart_key(day, fund)` (the page prefix + `date=<day>/charts/<FUND>.json`; `fund` must match
  `^[A-Z0-9]{1,8}$`) and handler `rivalfunds_chart` for `/rivalfunds/{day}/chart/{fund}`: 200 `application/json` with the
  object's bytes; bad day or bad fund -> 400; no object -> 404 JSON `{"error": "no chart for this fund and day"}`; over the cap
  -> the page's own over-cap refusal; every call audit-logged with `{"day", "fund", "route": "chart"}`. The route is declared
  in `ROUTE_CLASS` as `access-layer` and mounted in `server.py` by this cell.
- Rulings at the cut (issuer): CORRECTION -- the over-cap refusal is the page's own (502, `rivalfunds_view.py` `_serve_day`),
  not a 413. No viewer -> 401 as the other routes. The 200 and the 404 are audit-logged; a 400 and a 401 are not, as today.
  The `server.py` Route and the `ROUTE_CLASS` line are THIS cell's (the lane refuses the issuer's commit there: round 13
  AMENDMENT 1), so both files are in its paths.
- **Organic trigger:** a signed-in click on a security modal after RIV-md-1 is served.

### `RIV-md-1` -- the security modal draws the price curve with the fund's trade markers, by the page's ONE script (FWD-22; F.7)
- Interface: each `<section data-fund=...>` of a security dialog gains a chart frame `<div class=rf-chart data-chart-fund="<FUND>"
  data-chart-key="<security_key>">` holding a three-way range switch (30d first, then 90d, 365d), a words line (`data-chart-status`)
  and the fund's trade list in words (from the context's trades; present with or without the script). The page carries EXACTLY
  ONE inline `<script>` block with no `src`; `_BAD_CONSTRUCTS` admits that one block and still refuses every other script,
  `src=`, `<link`, `@import`, `url(`; `render.script_count(html) -> int`. The script: on a dialog opening, fetches
  `/rivalfunds/<page day>/chart/<FUND>` (same origin, once per fund, cached), draws an inline-SVG curve of the chosen range
  from `points`, breaks the line at gaps and prints each gap's reason, draws each marker as a hollow circle of radius `r` at
  its end date (green buy, red sell; a `span` marker also draws a bar over its window), shows price + date on pointing at any
  part of the curve and the marker's words on a marker, prints `source_words`. On a failed or missing object the status line
  reads "Chart could not load" and the trade list stays. `data-history=none` and HISTORY_NONE leave the dialog.
  The script lands on the SERVED page only after the chart route serves (issuer's sequencing at the deploy).
- Rulings at the cut (issuer): the script is emitted unconditionally by `render_page`; the route-before-script order is the
  issuer's deploy sequence, not a flag. The AUDIT page gets no chart frame and no script, and `validate_audit` /
  `validate_fund` still refuse any script. `data-chart-fund` carries the fund ticker exactly as the route takes it. The range
  switch is three buttons `<button data-chart-range="R30|R90|R365">` reading 30d, 90d, 365d, R30 marked current. The trade
  list is one line per trade from `trade_markers.words` when that module is importable, else the page's own trade words; a
  fund with no trade in the security lists none and says "No trades in the last 365 days".
- **Organic trigger:** opening a security modal from a fund's section on the live page.

## ROUND 16 (main workstream; the repair of round 15) -- APPENDED 2026-10-07, revision 1.6 of this file

One repair cell, on row ETFS_RIVALS-Z-S55 (the issuer's real run of round 15, record
`deliverables/2.0.0_SA_COO~RV/round15/real_run_2026-10-06.json`) and the ruling of 1.0.0_SA_CTO~Z msg 30787 (shape (a), four
terms). Author 2.0.0_SA_COO~RV. No earlier cell is replaced; RIV-ps-1, RIV-co-1 and RIV-md-1 stay for the orders that cite
them. Chain `~6`, one cell, files price_series.py, publish_page.py, render.py, risk SERVED.

### `RIV-pc-1` -- a holding-implied price is drawn only for a listing quoted in US dollars; the chart says the currency (FWD-22; row Z-S55; CTO ruling 30787)
- Measured (real run, day 2026-10-06, 13 chart objects, 695 fund-securities): 598 carry both source codes; the first market
  close over the last holding-implied price before it is above 3 or below 1/3 for 152 of 598 (JP 43/43, LN 54/54, HK 11/11,
  KS 9/9; US 0/238). The funds' holding reports are in US dollars; a Bloomberg close is in the listing's quote currency.
  G4 `security_market.currency` (Bloomberg `CRNCY`) is stored per security: on 2026-10-05, 0 of 578 priced rows carry none;
  values include `USD` 193, `EUR` 92, `JPY` 78, `GBp` 35 (London quotes in pence; 1 London listing is `USD`).
- Interface: `price_series.series` reads each key's quote currency from the G4 frame it is handed: the `currency` of the
  key's NEWEST G4 row that carries one (a row with no `px_close` still counts). The value is READ, never inferred from the
  exchange code. Exactly `"USD"` -> the series is built as today (`m`, then `i`, then a gap). Anything else, and a key
  with no stored currency, -> market closes only: a day with no positive close is `None` whatever the funds report, and
  its gap reason is `"no market close on file (the funds' holding reports are in US dollars and this listing is not quoted
  in US dollars)"`. Each key's result gains `"currency": <the stored string> | None`. `source_words` says in plain words
  which sources the series uses and, for a non-dollar listing, that the prices are in the listing's currency.
  The chart object's `securities[<key>]` gains `"currency"`. The page's one script shows the currency beside the price
  axis and in the hover's price words (`null` -> "currency not on file"). A trade marker is placed by its DATE on the
  curve and never by a dollar price; on a day with no price it keeps its date marker.
- Rulings at the cut (issuer): `load` reads G4 as it does today (the same window), so a key whose only G4 rows fall outside
  the window has no stored currency and is treated as non-dollar. The currency comparison is exact and case-sensitive
  (`GBp`, `ZAr`, `ILs`, `KWd` are not dollars). No new Bloomberg field is requested and nothing under `integrations/`
  changes. The fixtures of `round15/checks/co-1.AC1.py`, `co-1.AC2.py`, `md-1.AC1.py` and `md-1.AC2.py` hold no G4
  currency; the cell may plant G4 rows carrying `currency` `USD` (no `px_close`) for those fixtures' securities and add
  `"currency"` to an exact key set those checks compare, and may change nothing else in them.
- **Organic trigger:** opening a non-US security's modal on the live page; the issuer's real run re-measures the 598.
