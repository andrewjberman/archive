# ETFS_RIVALS -- surprise channel, INVESTIGATION v1 (site-Z fabric)

**Home:** the project tree's channel. Lane `ANY`; `.tools/surprise-row-gate.py` validates every NEW row
(schema, identity, coordinate, folder == project). **Append-only.**

**Id grammar on this fabric:** a seat's row is `ETFS_RIVALS-Z-S<k>`; a worker's row is
`ETFS_RIVALS-Z-W<n>-S<k>` with `<n>` its slot; `<k>` restarts at 1 per coordinate. `"project":
"ETFS_RIVALS"` and `"fabric": "site-z"` on every new row. The CVO's adjudication rows live in
`adjudications/`, never here.
