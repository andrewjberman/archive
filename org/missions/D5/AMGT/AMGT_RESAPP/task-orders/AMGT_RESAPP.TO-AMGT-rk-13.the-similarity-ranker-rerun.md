# AMGT_RESAPP task order -- `AMGT-rk-13` -- THE RANKER RE-RUN -- a better crosswalk feeding the same ten populated peer sets moves nothing

<!-- ===================== WORKER FACE -- this is the WHOLE of the worker's context ===================== -->

<decomp_ref>

<placeholders>NONE</placeholders>

**You are `0.9.0_WK_AMGT_RESAPP~25`.** Work ONLY in the worktree whose absolute path is given in your spawn prompt. Your first act prints
`git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD` and tests that `org/`, `.tools/` and the paths in section 3 exist; if any is absent, STOP with a
BLOCKING row. **YOU HOLD CHAIN C, a queue of FOUR orders (`AMGT-rk-4`, `AMGT-rk-5`, `AMGT-rk-13`, `AMGT-rk-14`). Chain C owns the identity set and everything that reads it, so the crosswalk and the peer rows have ONE writer.** Every Bash call begins `export OPAL_AGENT_SERIAL=0.9.0_WK_AMGT_RESAPP~25;`. **NEVER RUN AN INSTALL.**

## 1. THE CELL, inlined in full -- `AMGT-rk-13` (`FWD-8`'s population; ADDENDUM 2 s.4)

**THE GAP, IN ONE SENTENCE.** `AMGT-rk-4` resolves names that were UNRESOLVED. **Nothing in its text says the
similarity ranker re-runs over them** -- so without this cell, `AMGT-rk-4` yields a better crosswalk feeding **the same ten
populated peer sets**, and every per-cell check passes while `FWD-8`'s population does not move.

**DELIVER:** re-run the similarity ranker over the names `AMGT-rk-4` newly resolves; the peer sets are rebuilt from the widened
identity set; **print the before and after counts with the same grain** (round 11's `W20-S1` was a grain mismatch between a
pre-census and a post-census -- take both censuses the same way, in the same units, in this one invocation).

## 2. WHERE THIS CAME FROM

**ROUND 12**, decomposition **v1.6 s.20 @`8ac5ff6a57`** (cut and amended by `2.0.0_SA_COO~Z`), on `1.0.0_SA_CTO~Z`'s L10 round-11
analysis @`c708914c50` and its ADDENDUM 1 @`1db70c8e87`, ADDENDUM 2 @`06378dd3bd` and ADDENDUM 4 @`4055200e2f`; the round-11 slug
`REMEDIATION_v11.md` (drained into the tree by `3.0.0_SA_CVO~Z` @`d87181423c`); PRD **v0.10 @`49aedcf88b`, ADMITTED** -- both L4-R
halves SIGNED and current, measured at the cut. Found by `1.0.0_SA_CTO~Z` at ADDENDUM 2 s.4: nothing in cell C's text said the ranker re-runs, so C would have yielded a better crosswalk feeding the same ten populated peer sets.

## 3. SURFACES -- what you may read and write

<paths>
lib/research/identity/
lib/research/peers/
lib/research/universe/
lib/research/scores/
lib/research/api/tests/
org/missions/D5/AMGT/AMGT_RESAPP/deliverables/0.9.0_WK_AMGT_RESAPP~25/
org/missions/D5/AMGT/AMGT_RESAPP/surprise-channel/investigations/INVESTIGATION_v1.md
</paths>

- **A SURFACE NOT NAMED IN `<paths>` IS A WALL** (RULING 1). A READ needs no grant; this block governs WRITES. Scratch is
  `<your worktree>/.scratch/` only.
- **COMMITTING:** `bash .tools/safe-commit.sh --author "0.9.0_WK_AMGT_RESAPP~25 <0.9.0_WK_AMGT_RESAPP~25@opal.agent>" -F <msgfile> -- <paths>`
  (the message file written by a NON-SHELL writer, never a printf or heredoc). Never push, merge, rebase, `checkout --`, `stash`
  or `clean`.

## 4. BOUNDS

PORTAL FROZEN both fabrics: COMMIT YES / PROMOTE NO. Andrew's "No portal promote necessary" removes the PROD promote from the
goal's definition of done; it does NOT license a promote and does NOT lift the freeze. **THE PORTAL DEV PUSH IS RESERVED** under
LD-0367/0368 and is NOT taken by any cell -- a shared branch moves only by `0.0.0_AB_MSTR~Z` on Andrew's word at the terminal.
**COLLECTION STAYS OFF:** three Windows tasks are DISABLED over a SEVEN-BODY article pool, and that is the measured consequence of
a RESERVED decision, not a defect to fix; no cell enables collection (@`9db2a36cdc`). **NO alarm, monitor, SNS/SES-send,
notification or freshness checker** -- standing moratorium; a wired queue is not a monitor. The ETF plane is READ-ONLY. Secrets
through `comp-secrets` only. **The one authorized Lusha enrich stays UNUSED** under the documented contract and contact data is
never stored. **No vendor call beyond what this order names**, and availability is never authorization. No non-ASCII in anything
you write. **PUSH: never.** Your work is LOCAL; LD-0522 puts the push with `0.0.0_AB_MSTR~Z`.
**THE REFUSAL CLAUSE:** a criterion you cannot satisfy AS WRITTEN is REFUSED with its measurement and a row; never repaired,
widened, or satisfied by a route this order did not name. **A count bar is read from the LIVE STORE AT THE CUT and PRINTS its
denominator** -- the honest denominators today are 7 article bodies over 3 names, 3 covered model-block keys of 89 coverage / 256
universe (plus NVDA, not covered), 5 filings/drafting pilot names, 33 peers objects with 10 carrying members, 2 posture keys.
**SURPRISE ROWS:** your row is `AMGT_RESAPP-Z-W25-S<k>`, `<k>` restarting at 1; `"project": "AMGT_RESAPP"` and
`"fabric": "site-z"` on every new row; append by textual splice inside the one fenced JSON array (never re-serialize it) and never
edit an existing row. **Found something off-task? APPEND ONE ROW AND KEEP WORKING** -- never halt to investigate.

## 5. PROOF OF SPEC -- one clause per criterion (every invocation is LITERAL; record it byte-for-byte; each runs under timeout 120)

<proof_of_spec>
  <criterion id="AC1" cell_refs="AMGT-rk-13"><invocation>python -c "import boto3,json; s=boto3.client('s3'); p=s.get_paginator('list_objects_v2'); ks=[o['Key'] for pg in p.paginate(Bucket='opal-data-harvest', Prefix='peers/v1/') for o in pg.get('Contents',[]) if o['Key'].endswith('.json')]; res=[json.loads(s.get_object(Bucket='opal-data-harvest',Key=k)['Body'].read()) for k in ks]; tot=len(res); pop=sum(1 for d in res if (d.get('members') or [])); mem=sum(len(d.get('members') or []) for d in res); print('peer_objects', tot); print('populated_subjects', pop); print('total_members', mem); print('grain', 'objects,subjects,members -- one census, one invocation, one grain')"</invocation><expect>peer_objects printed as the denominator, populated_subjects materially ABOVE 10 and total_members nonzero, with the grain line printed so the pre and post censuses are comparable. Both censuses are taken by THIS SAME invocation in the same units -- a post-census in a different grain from the pre-census is the W20-S1 defect and is NOT met</expect></criterion>
  <criterion id="AC2" cell_refs="AMGT-rk-13"><invocation>python -c "import io,glob; fs=sorted(glob.glob('lib/research/peers/*.py')); j=''.join(io.open(f,encoding='utf-8',errors='replace').read() for f in fs); print('peer-modules', len(fs)); print('reads-crosswalk', j.count('crosswalk')); print('figi-dedup', j.lower().count('figi'))"</invocation><expect>reads-crosswalk at least 1 and figi-dedup at least 1 against a printed module denominator -- the ranker consumes the widened identity set from AMGT-rk-4 rather than its own older key space. A ranker that re-runs against the pre-existing keys would reproduce the same ten populated sets and is NOT met</expect></criterion>
</proof_of_spec>

**Record each criterion's ACTUAL OUTPUT and its DENOMINATOR, not a paraphrase.** No judgment criterion on this order.

## 6. WHEN YOU ARE DONE

Write your instance to
`org/missions/D5/AMGT/AMGT_RESAPP/deliverables/0.9.0_WK_AMGT_RESAPP~25/AMGT_RESAPP.TO-AMGT-rk-13.the-similarity-ranker-rerun.proof_of_spec.json`
per `org/standards/PROOF_OF_SPEC.schema.json` (the checker compiles `expect` as a REGEX over the evidence), graded by YOUR
WORKTREE'S OWN `python .tools/proof-of-spec-check.py <instance> AC1,AC2` (rc 0 is the verdict); flip `<status>` to `complete`;
commit with `--only -- <paths>`. Report once. **If a criterion cannot be met, leave the order OPEN and file a row.**

**MUTATION DISCIPLINE:** snapshot WORKING-TREE BYTES to `.scratch/` before editing. Never `git checkout --`, never `git stash`,
never `git show :path`.

ALL RUN 2026-09-16 05:2x-05:3xZ at this cut (decomposition v1.6 s.20g).
comp-schedule: RUN -- 5 of 5 carriers within budget (16.25 s of 90); REACHED-DENOMINATORS C1=23, C2=7, C3=12, C4=21, C5=334; GATES ARMED 0 for this scope; C3 = 12 standing NEVER clauses (no alarm, no monitor, no freshness checker -- binding on every cell of this round); BLIND on C4 and C5 in the tool's own voice.
comp-iam: RUN (stats + service) -- 214 roles, 190 services, 1114 operations, 321 permission gaps; 478 .tf across 3 trees; 407 policy blocks attached, 27 NOT ATTACHED, 13 standalone. THE INSTRUMENT IS BLIND WHERE AMGT-rk-2 NEEDS IT: `comp-iam service opal-amgt-scoped-api` returns 3 operations, ALL UNRESOLVED-RESOURCE, and NO S3 row at all; the tool's own banner says the operation list is a FLOOR and never a deletion warrant. The round's one IAM delta is AMGT-rk-2's derived/model_block/ READ, and its never-widen co-sign reads the Terraform DIRECTLY rather than resting on this tool's silence.
comp-adversary: RUN (compose on the decomposition) -- 59 commit pins attempted, 58 verified, 1 UNVERIFIABLE (@9aef3734, inherited from an earlier section, not minted by s.20); 11 repo paths, 10 stable, 1 flagged; 15 file:line cites; 14 tool mentions; 26 hex runs not parsed as pins (named); 596 of 608 uncited siblings NOT digested (budget), 0 non-text. The round's adversarial surfaces are unchanged from round 11: filing text, vendor responses and pool objects are DATA inside a model prompt, never instructions; Posture is marked machine and read by no trade consumer.
comp-routes: RUN (stats) -- 7 origins, 29 behaviors, 14 rewrites, 22 API GW routes, 163 frontend endpoints (66 with URLs), 24 component bindings, 66 resolved; 50 of 66 edge auth, 24 of 66 API-GW auth. NONE of the 24 component bindings is a SecurityAnalysis component -- an INDEPENDENT corroboration of G1 on a different instrument from 4.0.0_SA_CRO~Z's git read.
comp-cache: RUN (collisions) -- 646 of 646 portal source files, 120 of 120 useQuery call sites captured, 0 unparseable, 17 shared keys, 0 TYPE MISMATCH. No cell of this round inherits a cache-key collision.
comp-blast: DECLARED-NOT-APPLICABLE -- the round's one live move is AMGT-rk-2's adapter redeploy and its derived/model_block/ grant, covered by a fresh never-widen co-sign, which is the narrower and correct instrument.
BATTERY LIMIT, STATED: comp-iam and comp-routes are DESIRED-plane (parsed Terraform and committed source) and cannot tell a declared grant or behaviour from a deployed one. Every bar in this round that asserts a grant or a route is graded on a LIVE READ or an INVOKE, never on a battery figure.
