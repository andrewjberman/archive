# NFRA_CTLPLN -- surprise channel, INVESTIGATION v1 (laptop fabric)

**Opened by:** `3.0.0_SA_CVO`. **Home:** the project tree's channel; the gate `.tools/surprise-row-gate.py` validates every NEW
row (schema `org/surprise_channel/schemas/investigation_item.schema.json`). Lane `ANY`. A seat's row is `NFRA_CTLPLN-S<k>`; a
worker's is `NFRA_CTLPLN-W<n>-S<k>`. **Append-only during the round.** Never edit an existing row.

Either is an edit to main.tf or sqs.tf plus a re-run of check_queues.py; the check and the root are otherwise complete."
