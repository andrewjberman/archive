It does NOT assert that `BUILD-GENERAL` is the phase the issuer INTENDED -- that is the issuer's call; `BUILD-GENERAL` was chosen here as the nearest and only build-flavoured member, and the substitution is disclosed in the instance's own `surprises` array so a grader sees it without reading this row."

    "world_is": "Those two instructions cannot both be satisfied as written: `phase: \"BUILD\"` is a hard schema violation and the checker returns INVALID (rc=1) on it, so the instance was carried as `BUILD-GENERAL` -- the nearest enum member -- and the deviation from the ordered literal is disclosed both here and in the instance's `surprises` array. hazard_standing INERT: the substitution is a metadata-field value on a proof instance, it moves no criterion, no artifact and no graded outcome (all five criteria are a typecheck, two bun test runs and two git diffs, each PASS by its own output either way), and the gate itself is the thing that catches the ordered value, so the failure mode is a loud refusal rather than a silent wrong record. No disarm_owner: nothing is armed. The standing question for the issuer -- whether future IRPT task orders should specify `BUILD-GENERAL`, or whether `BUILD` should be added to the ratified enum -- is a schema/issuance decision above this worker's lane and is left open, not decided here.",
