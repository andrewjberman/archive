# Never-widen sign-off packet -- r34g: the resident r34f -> r34g at pin cd48501d0d (the upload door asks yfinance FIRST, YCharts second; opal_pricing ON)

**For:** `1.0.0_SA_CTO` (CTO half). **Author and operator:** `2.0.0_SA_COO~G2`, 2026-10-16. **Applier:** `0.7.0_AE_CloudOps~IB2` (rule 34, CTO msg 9561).
**Authority:** PRD v0.22 (Andrew-direct ~15:2xZ: "yfinance first and ycharts second as a general rule for any part of this process"); CTO msgs 9522 (the four items), 9600 (items 1 to 3 and pricing ON first, item 4 later; NOT installed while run 3 is pinned to r34f and its window is open or about to open), and 9685 (run 3's window is closed: r34g installs now under its own pair) and 9620 (item 3 is met for this release by naming the remaining YCharts calls). Cell AR-g-133 merged `c99d9e5269`; the id trace is `org/missions/D9/IRPT/IRPT_ANLREQ/deliverables/0.9.0_WK_IRPT_ANLREQ~266/YCHARTS_ID_TRACE.json` (merged `1180b2f0b1`).
**One move:** D1, the install of one new root on the resident host. One code member changes: `intake/security_resolution.py`; the bindings file changes in one binding (`opal_pricing.enabled` false -> true) and the pin. No IAM, Lambda, queue, table or schema moves; no new vendor call path (the door's Yahoo checker already exists; its cap and pacing are unchanged).

## 1. What ships

Package pin `cd48501d0d4022fa4aa1eb5611cdf4133876fa60`; base pin `0485393f3ad0a7e564f4867f5e70003e2e62195b`; built by `r34g_build.py` over the tools at that pin, BUILD ONLY, over the RUNNING r34f root (tarball sha256 `0d223e500a92aa274bbb52437d33657dd870b9f29af41ec942463c936d904a3f`). **314 members**: 311 identical to r34f, **3 changed**, 0 added, 0 removed.

| member | vs r34f | what changes |
|---|---|---|
| `intake/security_resolution.py` | changed (LIVE in the resident's runtime, static import walk) | `SecurityResolver.check` with a checker asks it ONCE about every uncached symbol (and every cached provider NOT_FOUND) BEFORE the provider; a symbol it KEEPS is final (the KEPT row of AR-y-293: `price_source` yfinance, no provider receipt) and never reaches YCharts; only the rest go to the provider in one call; a provider FOUND beats a NOT_KEPT; a NOT_KEPT stays the provider's NOT_FOUND with no second checker call; a CHECK_FAILED or NOT_CHECKED symbol the provider does not find reads UNAVAILABLE with its reason word as before; `verified_suggestions` also shows a candidate the checker KEPT |
| `reports/resident_bindings.json` | changed | `provenance.package_pin`, and `opal_pricing` from `{"enabled": false, ...}` to `{"enabled": true, "tiers": ["estate", "yfinance"]}` (the verifier proves no other key moved) |
| `SHA256SUMS` | changed | the package sums, replaced |

**Artifacts** (staged outside the repository; nothing uploaded):
- Tar `irpt-resident-0485393f3a-r34g.tar.gz`: sha256 `1e5b3ef4120b8799ebd5f1cf620044b01b5e1bfeac2e1d4169d3f576a802580b`, 1,122,209 bytes, 314 members.
- Package sums `irpt-resident-0485393f3a-r34g.package.SHA256SUMS`: sha256 `31813fd356336524b9ee76daa6411bef60ac57dba5bd53806c537f11396f3936`.
- Host install script `resident_host_install_0485393f3a-r34g.sh`: sha256 `ef1e4999f585d640ec738992a7705771a716179286a2ab05186f0e7c21769b1a`; `install_r34.sh` `ac7973a340b34795e24f8adf316516399e18751f01aeff8597891f92d97295ce`; `pre_read_r34.sh` `3ddefb0070f15a6dcb93c2e63cf6e3c29cf7da414c63eac60991756d039e0f9a`; `rollback_r34.sh` `e5bae4155c0208e2213f0e47524a0fee56da8feb465cc7a1320d0a60bffb62cd`.
- V2 script `v2_service_env_r34g.sh` (in the repository at `org/tier1_exec/2.0.0_SA_COO~G2/deliverables/r34/`): sha256 `e8bc0fc4ef3bd5c0b5c50fd0d310dcc1c302548f1eb161bab8a54b689a776fba`; its offline test printed 22 cases OK.
- The capture library, wrapper, the WAF back-off (r34f), the Yahoo checker and every other member are unchanged.

## 2. Blast radius, by branch (read from the code at the pin)

| what | BEFORE (r34f) | AFTER (r34g) |
|---|---|---|
| the upload door, a symbol Yahoo keeps (history at T-1) | one YCharts securities_info lookup first, Yahoo only after a YCharts NOT_FOUND | KEPT without a YCharts call; zero YCharts lookups when every symbol is kept |
| the upload door, a symbol Yahoo does not keep, or a Yahoo failure | YCharts lookup; NOT_FOUND then asked Yahoo | Yahoo asked first (one batch, the checker's cap of 10 and 1 s pacing unchanged), then YCharts for these symbols; FOUND beats NOT_KEPT; the unavailable and not-checked reasons read as before |
| Yahoo called for every uncached symbol rather than only for YCharts misses | -- | more Yahoo calls per upload, bounded by the checker's cap of 10; a symbol beyond the cap reads NOT_CHECKED and goes to YCharts (named, not a stop; raising the cap is a Yahoo-pushback question for the CTO) |
| the Opal producer's report (producers `andrew@opalinvest.com`, `fwd1-staff-r41b@opal.invalid`) | unpriced (`opal_pricing` off) | priced from the chain the resident reads today: estate, then yfinance, as_of T-1 (resident_installed.py, AR-g-90); the YCharts recipe path is not touched |
| cached answers (FOUND 86400, NOT_FOUND 900, KEPT 900) | served with no call | unchanged |
| the report built by YCharts (recipe: upload, create, status, read-back, validate, generate, download) | 8 to 9 YCharts calls per report | unchanged: those calls are the "remaining YCharts calls" of PRD v0.22 item 3 (CTO msg 9620). The Opal-built report path is FWD-7's own outcome, a later ENGINE cell |
| the lease, the WAF back-off, the swap pass, the pool, the checker, the producer list | -- | unchanged (the other 311 members are byte-identical to r34f) |

**Known limits (named, not stops).** (1) Item 4, the lease count per window, is NOT in this release (CTO msg 9600); the AR-g-129 back-off is the fallback. (2) A holding Yahoo keeps but YCharts does not carry is KEPT at the door and still cannot be in a YCharts-built report (the vendor echo refuses an omitted holding: recipe.py:541-545); today it goes through C-SWAP's replacement. (3) With pricing ON the Opal producer prices its report; the first live priced run is a separate act.

**Writers counted.** `intake/security_resolution.py`: ONE writer (the builder, for this release). The bindings file and the package sums: ONE (the builder).

## 3. Apply protocol, in this order

1. **Run 3's window is closed (CTO msg 9685, RUN3_OUTCOME @2e87b54871):** r34g installs now under this pair; window 4 is pinned to r34g by `~Y2`'s new addendum. No run is using the resident's door when the GO is sent (the applier reads the queue 0 0 at P1).
2. Both halves at HEAD naming this file's blob. The ledger `irpt-resident-r34g-20261016` is opened first; read every live worktree's `.open_deploys/` and print the denominator (another open entry naming the resident host, the unit or its root is a STOP).
3. **Send every host script AS ROOT.** Before-read: `pre_read_r34.sh` (fail-closed: the running root must be `0485393f3a-r34f`; the r34g root absent; the library and wrapper unmoved; the changed member at its r34f value).
4. D1: upload the tar, the sums file and the host script to the keys the install script names (each key must read 404 first; record the S3 versions); `install_r34.sh` fetches the host script and the sums BY KEY and refuses unless their sha256 equal `WANT` / `WANTSUM`.
5. V1: running root `0485393f3a-r34g`; the 3 changed members at their built value; the package sums 313 of 313 OK; the imports; queue 0/0; no sign-in in the journal; `opal_pricing` reads enabled true.
6. **V2, INSIDE the service's own environment:** `v2_service_env_r34g.sh`, sha256 `e8bc0fc4ef3bd5c0b5c50fd0d310dcc1c302548f1eb161bab8a54b689a776fba` (verify before sending). It keeps r34f's four controls and the back-off check, and adds `V2S DOOR` (the shipped resolver, imported on the service's flat import path with fake ports, asks the checker once about both symbols and the provider only about the one not kept) and `V2S PRICING` (the shipped bindings carry the pricing ON). No YCharts call.
7. **Gate:** anything but `V2S OK` (or an install that did not print its success line): send `rollback_r34.sh` AS ROOT the same session, read the running root back as `0485393f3a-r34f`, close the ledger ROLLED-BACK, report. No retry.
8. The ledger closes at V2.

**Live proof is a separate act** (an upload whose symbols Yahoo keeps, read at the door: zero YCharts lookups).

## 4. Rollback, per key

- **The root:** `rollback_r34.sh` (or the install's own failure branch) restores `0485393f3a-r34f`, which stays on the host.
- **The receipt:** the r34f receipt is kept by the install and copied back.
- **The library:** unchanged bytes before and after.
- **Queued messages:** none are touched; a message received after a rollback is served by r34f.

## 5. Not claimed

- That Yahoo answers for every symbol it keeps within the checker's cap, or that a larger first batch does not draw Yahoo pushback (V2 asks Yahoo for two symbols; the door test uses fake ports).
- That a priced Opal report is correct on live data: V2 reads the binding, not a report.
- The live host, S3 objects, running root and receipt were NOT read (this is a build record).

## COO half -- 2.0.0_SA_COO~G2

SIGNED, 2026-10-16, on this packet's bytes at the commit that carries it. The write set is: one new root directory on the resident host (`/opt/irpt-resident/0485393f3a-r34g`); the receipt and its r34f copy; the unit's ExecStart; the kept library copy; one transient systemd unit for V2. The blast radius is section 2; the rollback is section 4.
