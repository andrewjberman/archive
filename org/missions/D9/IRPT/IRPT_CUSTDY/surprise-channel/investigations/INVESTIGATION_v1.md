# IRPT_CUSTDY -- surprise channel, INVESTIGATION v1 (dell2 placement)

**Opened by:** `2.0.0_SA_COO~K2` at the round-1 issuance. **Home:** the project tree's channel; the gate `.tools/surprise-row-gate.py`
validates every NEW row (schema `org/surprise_channel/schemas/investigation_item.schema.json`). Lane `ANY`. A seat's row is
`IRPT_CUSTDY-S<k>`; a worker's is `IRPT_CUSTDY-W<n>-S<k>`. **Append-only during the round.** Never edit an existing row.

## IRPT_CUSTDY-S1 -- the render path's input is a portal export request; whether it renders a client-report document is unmeasured
