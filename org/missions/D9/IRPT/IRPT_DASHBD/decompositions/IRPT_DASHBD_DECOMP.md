# IRPT_DASHBD -- L5 decomposition -- workstream B (backend) -- round 1 -- v0.1

**v0.1** (2026-09-30 ~15:5xZ, `2.0.0_SA_COO~P`, on PRD v0.2 @84cff9014b, ADMITTED with both L4-R halves signed: ratified-text
`3.0.0_SA_CVO` @9914eab4f4, brief half by CRO authorship; CTO 103251/103257/103260/103263/103264). Round 1 builds THE THREAD (PRD
section 2, FWD-1): one 49 Financial account end to end, B's hops 1-4 and the served file's read route; F's hop 5 is `2.0.0_SA_COO~D`'s
under C-LEASE and is not decomposed here. Workstream F has its own decomposition; this document declares B's cells only.

## 0. What the thread is, and what is owned elsewhere

Hop 1 (silver -> gold `account_return_daily` under its contract, the guard applied) and hop 2 (gold -> platinum `series.json.gz` +
`manifest.json`) are B's by the PRD; hop 3 (the served file -> the signed-in page) crosses the seam: the FILE is B's and the read
route that hands it to the page is B's (the page is F's, hop 4-5). Owned elsewhere and consumed, never built here: the holdings
price return (IRPT_BCKEND's `holdings_performance_daily`, C-GUARD); the canonical classes (MDPF_SECCLASS; no class table in round 1);
the news tables; the Black Diamond pulls already landed in bronze (the tie-out oracle, C-TIEOUT); the registry (LGIC; a policy row is
added, never a typed key).

## 1. ROUND 1, WORKSTREAM B (2026-09-30 ~15:5xZ, issuer 2.0.0_SA_COO~P, on PRD v0.2 section 2 and ADDENDUM v0.2 rulings 11-14)

**Builder output at the cut (rule 30; `lib/opal_naming.py` at HEAD, 15:4xZ, no refusal):**
gold `address("irpt","49financial","gold","account_return_daily","date=2026-09-29")` ->
`s3://opal-data-49financial/irpt/49financial/gold/account_return_daily/date=2026-09-29`;
`address("irpt","49financial","gold","dim_return_method","method_version=1")` ->
`s3://opal-data-49financial/irpt/49financial/gold/dim_return_method/method_version=1`;
platinum `address("irpt","49financial","platinum","reporting","account=0027265115","series.json.gz")` ->
`s3://opal-data-49financial/irpt/49financial/platinum/reporting/account=0027265115/series.json.gz` (and `manifest.json`);
names `name("irpt","49financial","reporting-publish","lambda")` -> `irpt-49f-reporting-publish-lambda`,
`("irpt","49financial","reporting-publish","daily")` -> `irpt-49f-reporting-publish-daily`,
`("irpt","49financial","reporting-publish","role")` -> `irpt-49f-reporting-publish-role`,
`("irpt","49financial","reporting-read","lambda")` -> `irpt-49f-reporting-read-lambda`.

**Where IRPT_BCKEND's producer runs today (the PRD's round-1 reading, section 4 row 1):** as a scheduled Lambda that packages the DS
producer UNEDITED (`infra/aws/terraform/investor-reporting/holdings-performance/lambda.tf`; `lambda-source-map.json` entry
`irpt-holdings-performance-lambda` with `staged_from` pins for `data/assets/scripts/gold/irpt_holdings_performance/*`,
`lib/opal_naming.py`, `lib/trading_calendar.py` and the registry files). So the adapter is a DS-lane gold script beside it, run ad hoc for
the round-1 sample (a QA run; the scheduled fire is a round-2 cell under its own ledger, exactly as IB-er-203 followed IB-er-202), and
the publisher is a Lambda with its own root and schedule (C-MORATORIUM: its own cron, never success-of-upstream).

**The reading behind the read route (hop 3):** the page today reads served IRPT JSON through a per-function Lambda that registers
`ROUTES = {ROUTE_KEY: OPERATION}` and resolves the viewer's selection through the `_scope` enforcer before any S3 read
(`infra/aws/lambda/investor-reporting/holdings/entry.py:38-55, :136-150`, function `irpt-holdings`). The series read mirrors that shape
under its own function; adding a route inside another function's boundary is the W88-S1 trap (IRPT_BCKEND) and is not taken.

| cell | serves | risk | depends on | chain |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `DB-b-1` | FWD-1 hop 1, FWD-8, FWD-9: the 49 Financial adapter `data/assets/scripts/gold/irpt_reporting/account_return_daily.py` + its `sources.json` declaration (Schwab `dim_position`, `dim_balance`, `fact_trn` with the ratified 187-code table read as DATA from `org/tier1_exec/4.0.0_SA_CRO/deliverables/SCHWAB_TRANSACTION_CODE_CLASSIFICATION_20260811.json`, the flow classes of `c00_flow_ledger.py` read as data, no import of `c02_twr_engine.py`); C-METHOD daily TWR with end-of-day external flows, income on receipt, `V` = `dim_balance.net_mv_plus_cash` (C-VALUE verified); C-GUARD against `holdings_price_return` read from IRPT_BCKEND's gold; the tolerance, large-flow share and plausibility band MEASURED from the five sample accounts' own distribution and written to `dim_return_method` (method_version 1, Account365, `income_basis cash_when_received`, `fee_basis GROSS_ONLY`, `flow_convention END` pending DB-b-3); the two contract files `org/standards/IRPT_DASHBD_ACCOUNT_RETURN_DAILY_CONTRACT.json` (rule-24 record per ADDENDUM ruling 12: `history_scope`, `day_quality`, per-column `<col>_reason`, `return_basis` closed) and `org/standards/IRPT_DASHBD_DIM_RETURN_METHOD_CONTRACT.json`; the `reporting_policies.json` rows for the two tables (S17); the gold emitted for the five sample accounts over their full history (2024-07-09 .. the frontier) at the builder's addresses; ledger `irpt-dashbd-account-return-daily-49f-r1-20260930` | WORLD (new gold objects; nothing served reads them) | none | A |
| `DB-b-2` | FWD-1 hop 2, FWD-9: the platinum publisher `irpt-49f-reporting-publish-lambda` on `irpt-49f-reporting-publish-daily` (Terraform root `infra/aws/terraform/investor-reporting/reporting-publish/`, source `infra/aws/lambda/investor-reporting/reporting-publish/`, packaged through `lambda-source-map.json` + `build-and-upload.sh` like `irpt-holdings-performance-lambda`), reading gold `account_return_daily` + `dim_return_method` and writing per account `series.json.gz` (columnar arrays: date, value, total_return_daily, return_basis, day_quality, external_flow, income, holdings_price_return, method_version, as_of, first_data_date, drawdown_episodes by the `irpt-narrative` rule; class arrays absent and declared optional until `account_class_daily` exists) and `manifest.json` (method version, as-of, coverage summary, byte sizes), under `org/standards/IRPT_DASHBD_SERIES_CONTRACT.json` (C-SEAM, B the only writer); ONE local `--upload` run for the five sample accounts writes the files at the builder's addresses (WORLD: new platinum keys, nothing served reads them); the Terraform plan printed (the apply is the issuer's under its own ledger); size and build time printed; ledger `irpt-dashbd-reporting-publish-49f-r1-20260930` | WORLD (new platinum objects; a new Lambda + schedule planned) | DB-b-1 (reads its gold) | B |
| `DB-b-3` | FWD-8 (ADDENDUM ruling 11, C-TIEOUT, C-FLOWTIME): the tie-out harness over the FIVE sample accounts against Black Diamond's own `performancePeriod` returns ALREADY LANDED in bronze (`s3://opal-data-assets/blackdiamond/49f/bronze/reporting_performance/<pull date>/reporting_performance_<relationship>_<period end>.json`, pull dates 2026-07-17, 08-30, 08-31, 09-01; roster `blackdiamond/49f/_ops/taxsma_roster.json` maps `bd_internal_id` -> `schwab_account`): NO vendor call. For every (account, period) the oracle carries: Opal's daily-TWR link over the same window under the three flow-timing conventions (START, END, MIDPOINT), the absolute difference, and per disagreeing day its stated reason (flow timing, missing price, income date, `day_quality`); summary median / p90 / max; the PROPOSED `tieout_tolerance` and the winning convention, written into `IRPT_DASHBD_DIM_RETURN_METHOD_CONTRACT.json` and the `dim_return_method` row (C-FLOWTIME); record `deliverables/0.4.0_DS_ClientPlatform~S/tieout/TIEOUT_49F_BLACKDIAMOND_R1.json` + one page md for the CTO's ruling | LOCAL (a measurement; one gold row's field moves under DB-b-1's ledger, re-opened as leg M1) | DB-b-1 | A |
| `DB-b-4` | FWD-1 hop 3: the read route `irpt-49f-reporting-read-lambda` (source `infra/aws/lambda/investor-reporting/reporting/entry.py`, root `infra/aws/terraform/investor-reporting/reporting-read/`) that hands the signed-in page the thread account's `series.json.gz` and `manifest.json` after the `_scope` enforcer covers the account (mirrors `holdings/entry.py`'s shape; its own function, never a route added inside another function's boundary); the Terraform plan printed (the apply is the issuer's); a local invoke against the REAL S3 objects proves the bytes and the refusal branch | WORLD (a new served function planned; no apply in the cell) | DB-b-2 (reads its objects) | B |

**Chain read.** M = 2: chain A = `DB-b-1` -> `DB-b-3` (the DS lane's queue: the adapter, then the measurement over its gold); chain
B = `DB-b-2` -> `DB-b-4` (a worker's queue: the publisher, then the read route over its objects). Chain B's first criterion reads chain
A's gold, so its worker is spawned when `DB-b-1` reports the gold landed (the spawn is the GO; nothing waits on a message). N = 2, K = 8.
Write sets are disjoint: `DB-b-1`/`DB-b-3` write under `data/assets/scripts/gold/irpt_reporting/`, `org/standards/IRPT_DASHBD_ACCOUNT_*`,
`org/standards/IRPT_DASHBD_DIM_*`, `infra/logic/registry/reporting_policies.json` and the gold keys; `DB-b-2`/`DB-b-4` write under
`infra/aws/lambda/investor-reporting/{reporting-publish,reporting}/`, `infra/aws/terraform/investor-reporting/{reporting-publish,reporting-read}/`,
`org/standards/IRPT_DASHBD_SERIES_CONTRACT.json`, `lambda-source-map.json` and the platinum keys. The two applies (publisher + schedule;
read function + route) are the issuer's served acts after the drains, each under its own ledger and, for the read route, both halves.

**Battery (the COO minimum before decomposing):** `comp-blast` -- RUN: the four cells write NEW keys and NEW functions only; 0
existing readers of any written key (comp-estate places `account_return_daily` in 0 of 135 chains; the platinum prefix is new).
`comp-routes` -- RUN as a reading: no existing route moves; `DB-b-4` adds one under its own function, so the static route table gains a
row at the apply, never a modified one. `comp-cache` -- DECLARED-NOT-APPLICABLE: no CloudFront or cache surface is touched in round 1.
`comp-pipescript overlap` -- DECLARED-NOT-APPLICABLE: the adapter shares no output key with any gold script (its table is new).

**Seating.** `DB-b-1` and `DB-b-3` go to `0.4.0_DS_ClientPlatform~S` (rule 13; its IRPT_BCKEND order TO-IB-pr-263 is superseded
@ed0be5b557, so the instance holds one project). `DB-b-2` and `DB-b-4` go to `0.9.0_WK_IRPT_DASHBD~1` (a new project's first slot),
spawned on the DS report that the gold landed. Andrew's seating of `2.0.0_SA_COO~P` on this backend beside IRPT_BCKEND is the PRD's
section 5 (the register row says so).

**Carried, not cut (the enrichment backlog, PRD section 3 B1-B8):** `account_class_daily`; activity and lots; `account_transaction`;
`market_topic_daily` and its scope row; the Inflection and Cottonwood adapters; `account_dim` and the household files; the C-LABEL switch;
the scheduled fire of the adapter (round 2, its own ledger, as IB-er-203 was to IB-er-202).

fanout: 2 of 2 chains, cap 8.
