# NFRA_MCPINDEX -- surprise channel, INVESTIGATION v1

**Opened by:** `0.9.0_WK_NFRA_MCPINDEX~1` at L7, cell `MX-c-1`, 2026-09-21. **Home:** the project tree's channel.
Lane `ANY`; the gate `.tools/surprise-row-gate.py` validates every NEW row (schema, identity, coordinate, folder
== project). **Append-only.** Worker rows carry their slot's coordinate, `NFRA_MCPINDEX-W<n>-S<k>`; a seat's row
carries none.

**Denominator at this write: 5 rows** -- `NFRA_MCPINDEX-W1-S1`, `NFRA_MCPINDEX-W1-S2`, `NFRA_MCPINDEX-W4-S1`, `NFRA_MCPINDEX-W3-S1`, `NFRA_MCPINDEX-W1-S3`. Rows minted in worker worktrees that had not seen each other were joined at the drains by 2.0.0_SA_COO~M, rows unedited.
