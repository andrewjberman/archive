# NFRA_OPLGTW -- surprise channel, INVESTIGATION v1

**Opened by:** `2.0.0_SA_COO~O` at L6, 2026-09-15. **Home:** the project tree's channel. Lane `ANY`; the gate
`.tools/surprise-row-gate.py` validates every NEW row (schema, identity, coordinate, folder == project). **Append-only.**
Worker rows carry their slot's coordinate, `NFRA_OPLGTW-W<n>-S<k>`; a seat's row carries none.

**Why this file is opened at the issuance.** The first row was found while grounding the task orders' test criteria: the
Gateway's existing test suite does not pass at the cut base, so every "whole suite passes" criterion of this round has to
name the one known failure instead of silently inheriting it.

**Denominator at this write: 1 row** -- `NFRA_OPLGTW-S1`, 2.0.0_SA_COO~O at L6.
