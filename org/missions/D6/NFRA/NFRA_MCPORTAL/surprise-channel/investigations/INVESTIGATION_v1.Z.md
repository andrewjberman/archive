# NFRA_MCPORTAL -- surprise channel, INVESTIGATION v1.Z (round 1, site-Z fabric)

**Home:** the project tree's channel (`org/standards/PROJECT_TREE.contract.json` `surprise_channel_glob`); the gate
`.tools/surprise-row-gate.py` validates every NEW row (schema, identity, folder == project). Lane `ANY` -- the seat
that sees it appends its own row; REMEDIATION rows stay the CVO's.
**Append-only during the round.** Denominator at this write: **1 row** (this file's first).

## S1 -- the owned-paths worker-grant clause (ADHC_OWNPTH.005) never fires for a path with no existing lane pattern

Worked around THIS COMMIT via the documented audited escape hatch (`GIT_COMMIT_AUTHOR_OVERRIDE=0.9.0_WK_NFRA_MCPORTAL~1`, CLAUDE.md 14a) rather than by editing `.tools/owned-paths-validate.py` or `.owned-paths.yaml`, neither of which are in this task order's `<paths>` grant. Not scoped to mcportal: any worker's first commit of a genuinely new top-level path hits this same gap."
