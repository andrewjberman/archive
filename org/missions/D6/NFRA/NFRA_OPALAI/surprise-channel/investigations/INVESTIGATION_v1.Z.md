# NFRA_OPALAI -- surprise channel, INVESTIGATION v1 (site-Z fabric)

**Opened by:** `2.0.0_SA_COO~O`, 2026-09-24, at L5. **Home:** the project tree's channel. Lane `ANY`;
`.tools/surprise-row-gate.py` validates every NEW row (schema, identity, coordinate, folder == project).
**Append-only.**

**Id grammar on this fabric:** a seat's row is `NFRA_OPALAI-Z-S<k>`; a worker's row is `NFRA_OPALAI-Z-W<n>-S<k>`
with `<n>` its slot; `<k>` restarts at 1 per coordinate. `"project": "NFRA_OPALAI"` and `"fabric": "site-z"` on
every new row. The CVO's adjudication rows live in `adjudications/`, never here.
