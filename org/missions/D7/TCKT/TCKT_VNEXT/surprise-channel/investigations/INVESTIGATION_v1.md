# TCKT_VNEXT -- surprise channel, INVESTIGATION v1 (round 1, dell2 fabric)

**Opened by:** `2.0.0_SA_COO~V2` ahead of the L5 cut (seat rows; the CVO assembles from L8 -- spine v3 L8).
**Home:** the project tree's channel (`org/standards/PROJECT_TREE.contract.json` `surprise_channel_glob`); the gate
`.tools/surprise-row-gate.py` validates every NEW row (schema `org/surprise_channel/schemas/investigation_item.schema.json`).
Lane `ANY`.
**Id grammar:** a worker's row is `TCKT_VNEXT-D2-W<n>-S<k>`; a seat's row is `TCKT_VNEXT-D2-S<k>` (dell2 coordinate); the CVO's adjudication rows
live in `../adjudications/` as `TCKT_VNEXT-C-S<k>`.
**Append-only during the round.** Never edit an existing row.
