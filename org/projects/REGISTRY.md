# Project Registry

All active and completed projects. Each project has a project code, a macro code,
a JSON file, and a PRD set.

**Project code format:** `{MACRO}_{6CHAR}` (e.g., `ADVI_V1VERS`)
**Thread serials:** `{PROJECT_CODE}-{NNN}` (e.g., `ADVI_YANGV2-001`)
**Project JSON:** `org/projects/{PROJECT_CODE}.json`

Multiple projects can share the same macro code. The macro code identifies
the surface area; the project code identifies the specific initiative.

## Adding a new project

1. Pick the macro code from `org/projects/MACRO_CODES.md` (or add one if the surface area isn't listed)
2. Choose a 6-char project suffix that abbreviates the initiative name
3. Project code = `{MACRO}_{6CHAR}`
4. Create `org/projects/{PROJECT_CODE}.json` (copy any existing project JSON as template)
5. Required fields: `project_code`, `macro_code`, `name`, `description`, `prds` (array),
   `status`, `phase`, `pods`, `blocking`, `created`, `thread_counter`, `threads`
6. Add a row to the Active Projects table above
7. Commit with: `org(1.0.0_SA_CTO): register project {PROJECT_CODE}`

## Closing a project

1. Set `status` to `"complete"` in the JSON
2. Move the row from Active to Completed/Archived in this table
3. PRDs stay in `docs/architecture/` -- do not archive active project PRDs

## Thread serial format

`{PROJECT_CODE}-{NNN}` where NNN is zero-padded to 3 digits.
Thread folder: `org/threads/{PROJECT_CODE}-{NNN}-{slug}/`
Receipt in agent folder: `{PROJECT_CODE}-{NNN}-{slug}_{other_serials}.md`

When creating a thread for a project, pass `--project {PROJECT_CODE}` to `create-thread.sh`.
The script auto-assigns the next serial and updates the project JSON.

## PRD location

All active PRDs live in `docs/architecture/`. Pre-org-system (v1 era) architecture docs
are archived to `docs/architecture/archive/` and are not referenced by any active project.
